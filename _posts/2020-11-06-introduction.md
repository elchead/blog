Congratuations to being one of the first visitors on this new blog. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of content yet, but feel free to check it later again :)

The goal is to share content I'm interested in with you. If any topic speaks to you, I'd be happy to get in touch and hear about your thoughts and suggestions!

I've planned to post stuff concerning the following topics:
- Programming

Stay tuned!
## Quick intro

I'm Adrian, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Science & Engineering at TU Munich.
Besides my newly discovered passion for programming, I've been an enthusiastic language learner since my early teenage-times. After English and Spanish, my latest endevaour has been learning Chinese.
Also, this year I got super hyped about productivity and personal knowledge management (PKR). I'm still in developing phase, but I will share it with you later.
