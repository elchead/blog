Congratulations on being one of the first visitors to this new blog.

If any topic speaks to you, I'd be happy to get in touch and hear about your thoughts and suggestions!

I've planned to post stuff concerning the following topics:

- Programming
- Learning Chinese
- Productivity

Stay tuned!

## Quick intro

I'm Adrian, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Science & Engineering at TU Munich.
Besides my newly discovered passion for programming, I've been an enthusiastic language learner since my early teenage-times. After English and Spanish, my latest endeavor has been learning Chinese.
Also, this year I got super hyped about productivity and personal knowledge management (PKR). I'm still in the developing phase, but I will share it with you later.

To see more about what I've been up for, you can check my [Resume](/cv).
