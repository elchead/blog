title: Ship it - My public journal

Inspired by [Jen Vermet's](https://www.jenvermet.com/) ship-it and weekly letters, I will start to share my thoughts and learnings in public. I love how personal and introspective her thoughts and shared experiences are.
I've started [journaling last year](/posts/building-a-journaling-habit-with-obsidian/), but my thoughts are mostly very raw and hidden to the outside world. By starting a public journal, I want to challenge myself to become more open and overcome the imposter that my thoughts are not worth being shared.

I am still figuring out the format, if it will be weekly or daily. But my goal is to share my learnings and thoughts at least once per week.

You will find my entries [here](/categories/letters/).
