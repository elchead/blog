Since last summer, I am part of a Mentoring program called [SpeedupBuddy](https://speedupbuddy.de/), targeted towards students from non-academic families.
I'm very happy to have found a mentor with a very good match and he has been accompanying me on an interesting journey about finding out more about myself since then.
In the short article, I want to share my experience and some personal revelations I had since then.
