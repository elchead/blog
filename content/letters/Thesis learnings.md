This is mostly a rant on where I failed, because critic is how we learn, right? But maybe one positive thing first. In my 6 months research project I have yet proven another time to myself that I am good at driving projects on my own. My results are promising and I learnt to cope with many difficult challenges. Most importantly, the feeling of being stuck and experiencing to be on my own to fix it. No one could really help me (at least the experts where not within my reach). And I did it. Persistence was key.
Now lets get to the nitty-gritty: my failures.

I failed to have a bigger plan of scope. I had too many things I wanted to do and while restriciting myself along the way I still did not put right emphasis in the grander scheme. Research and development is tricky because there are unforeseen hurdles. Yet I feel that my effort was partially not well invested. I did not have a clear orientation when to give up. I rather fixated on fixing it until it was solved.  Before getting started I should have an idea of what the most important points of this project are. Should I give up on this little point to find enough energy for the bigger point? I think it was not bad to first explore potential and then decide to put focus in the direction of potential. Maybe I can't blame myself too much. I did in fact start with the most promising approach but it was promisign at all. The reason was that I did not do my research well on what kind of results I could expect based on prior research. And the reason for my slackness was also simple: I was too impatient and too much focused on doing. I always felt in a hurry to progress even when I wasn't. This lead to my subconscious believe that I don't have time to do it clean and well. Keeping a calm mind and not getting myself in a hurry is something I need to watch out for.  I should always have a bigger picture and define the daily goal before starting to work. This is how I learnt to do it for my personal life and so should I apply it to work life.Had I known that big container migrations can be performant, than I would not have invested so much effort in the much inferior approach of application migration.

I didn't have a bigger timeplan for the longest time and didn't trust it when it was late. This is maybe the reason I felt hurried. I didn't even follow my time plan because I felt there were more effective ways to approach it. I might be right that too big ahead planning is necessarily not optimal, because relevant information such as feedback meeting with the supervisor / unforeseen struggles are not yet available. My only conclusion here is: make a very coarse plan on what is important for the outcome and postpone the how-to decision as late as possible.

It's unrealistic that extensive problem can prevent all problems and can make everything go smooth, but I think I slacked off here. I need to be strict myself to always predefine the scope of what I am doing next. Also, I should think about a strategy of how to achieve what I want and not just go for the first thing that comes to mind. Otherwise I tend to act faster than I think which self-evidently leads to suboptimal results.
I caught myself several times that my first implementation idea was not the simplest.
The conclusion is that I need more structure in my work.
I used Obsidian and initially used daily notes to save information but this quickly became limiting. Complexity was growing and there were too many open points.
A Kanban board came handy for this because they allow put open points that I don't prioritize right now into another category than those I am currently working on.
While nice to be integrated into Obsidian as central source of knowledge, the Obsidian plugin quickly become lacking as well.
I missed the ability to assign priorities to my cards.
Furhermore I was not organized enough to clearly define the scope of the day. While I was always doing something thesis related (distractions were not a big problem), time was not always efficiently spent due to lack of scope / clearness of the goal. I most clearly felt this during the research period. I easily got suck into rabbit holes, jumping from one paper to the next and not really progressing so much on what is really relevant.
Again, lack of scope. I need to target my research more specifically. Stay high level and dig deeper after having a bigger picture.
