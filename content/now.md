<!-- {{< callout emoji="💯" text="This is the text that will show up in the callout. It can be as long as you like, but only one paragraph." >}} -->

### Professional status quo:

- Computational Science & Engineering (M.Sc.) student at TU Munich
- Trainee as part of the SAP STAR program

**Current work project**:
- writing my Master's thesis on resource management for HPC jobs with unpredictable memory needs in Kubernetes. I investigate the feasibility of job migration when a node runs out of memory. I'm looking both into complete containter / pod migration as well as application specific checkpointing of optimization problems.
The goal is to improve the cluster memory utilization while ensuring an unimpaired quality of service.
