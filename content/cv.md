**UPC Barcelona,** since Sept 2021

### Master's Degree in Computational Engineering & Science

**TU Munich,** since Oct 2020

### Exchange Semester in Computer Science and Mandarin

**Tsinghua University, Beijing,** Sept 2019 - Feb 2020

### Bachelor's Degree in Engineering Science

**TU Berlin,** Oct 2017 - Oct _2020_

- focus on fluid mechanics and numerical simulation

## 👨‍💻 Work experience
### SAP STAR trainee
**Working student,** SAP, since Mar 2021

Currently working on the open-source project [Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/), a tool to ease deployment of applications on Kubernetes.
### Post-processor and web development
**Working student,** [dive solutions GmbH](https://www.dive-solutions.de/), Nov 2020 - Jan 2021

Development for the micro-services of the cloud simulation suite. My main work was to develop a new post-processing package in Python.

### CFD development with FEM and SPH

**Intern, Bachelor thesis,** [dive solutions GmbH](https://www.dive-solutions.de/), May 2020 - Nov 20

I learned about the theory of **porous media** and a particle-based CFD method called SPH and developed a 1D solver for porous media in **Python** to solidify my understanding. Furthermore, I supported an industrial cooperation project. I conducted complex simulations by preparing the geometry using **CAD** software, building the setup in the company's **Python** interface, and evaluated the results in presentations for the client. I got involved in the **C++** solver development and integrated additional physical models.

As part of my thesis, I developed a **FEM** porous media solver from scratch with **C++.** After that, I coupled FEM-SPH for simulating free-fluid-flow and porous-flow interactions. After validating the solver, I demonstrated the industrial capability by simulating a rotating 3D washing drum.

### Insights into manufacturing

**Technical intern,** Ingenieurbetrieb Bickert, (Apr 2019- Jun 2019)

Assisted production and was introduced to company management and working procedures at a local milling engineering company.

### Development of a Postprocessing tool for Combustion Experiments

**Working student**, TU Berlin - Institute of Fluid Dynamics, (Oct 2018 - Sept 2019)

Built an automated **Python** script for postprocessing experimental data. The tool can read entire measurement campaigns, create individual plots, and evaluate the success rate (detonation detection) for different configurations. I was in main-charge of the development, but collaborated with the research group through **Git.**
