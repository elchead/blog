# 👋🏽 Hello

  <div class="home-content">

Adrian here — a software craftsman passionate about solving painful real world problems.

I have a background in Full-Stack, Cloud & AI to build solutions end-to-end.

Putting myself out here to connect:

- You have an idea to work on together?
- You just want to talk about programming?
- You’d like to review the code of one of your projects?
- Unsure about your career?

Reachouts are welcome!

Inspired by [Office hours](https://robertheaton.com/2019/12/05/why-i-have-office-hours-and-you-should-too/), I offer them / mentorship too!
