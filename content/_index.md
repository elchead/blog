# 👋🏽 Hello

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

Adrian here — an aspiring software craftsman and entrepreneur. I'm a full-stack builder, with a focus on backend development. I'm working on cloud 9 (aka K8s), and love to talk about clean code and testing.

TLDR:

#Kubernetes #Cloud #Web #CleanCode #TDD #Rust

See here what I'm doing [now](now) or my longer intro [here](about). Putting myself out here to connect. Reachouts are welcome!
