# 👋🏽 Hello

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

Adrian here — an aspiring software craftsman and entrepreneur. I'm a full-stack builder, with a focus on backend development. I'm working on cloud 9 (aka K8s), and love to talk about clean code and testing.

TLDR:

#Kubernetes #Cloud #Web #CleanCode #TDD #Rust

Putting myself out here to connect:

- You have an idea to work on together?
- You just want to talk about programming?
- You’d like to review the code of one of your projects?
- Unsure about your career?

Reachouts are welcome!

Inspired by [Office hours](https://robertheaton.com/2019/12/05/why-i-have-office-hours-and-you-should-too/), I offer office hours / mentorship too!
