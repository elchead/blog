It&amp;rsquo;s how I grew up and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to undo. Feelings make you vulnerable and I saw them as a burden to others. So I mostly kept them to myself. I found ways to process them: by studying, listening to music, exercising and sleeping. Basically, disengaging from my feelings and letting time heal everything. Time alleviates strong emotions. But I think that this evasive way also disconnects myself from people.</description></item></channel></rss>
