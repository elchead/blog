By starting a public journal, I want to challenge myself to become more open and overcome the imposter that my thoughts are not worth being shared.

It did not work out of the box and many instructions on the internet did not work for me. In the following, I want to share my setup. To set up the network and VMs, I followed this tutorial. After installing the default configuration of calico, inter-node communication between pods did not work. My working approach uses User-Defined-Routes (UDR) on Azure to route traffic from the different pod-subnets of each node. Be sure to only have one IP address assigned to each network interface! I installed the Azure CNI plugin before, which assigns pod IPs from the secondary IPs of the vnet that are assigned to the network interface. This caused problems in the IP detection in Calico, but it can be easily fixed by deleting the secondary IPs. When bootstrapping Kubernetes, you should also set the pod subnet (CIDR) to avoid address overlap with the virtual network. The default for kubeadm is 192.168.0.0/16 which indeed overlapped with my Azure network. This is my kubeadm config: cat conf.yaml apiServer: timeoutForControlPlane: 4m0s apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2 kind: ClusterConfiguration kubernetesVersion: v1.19.16 #-beta.0.1017_d0acb1e3ae68d3-dirty networking: podSubnet: \"172.16.0.0/16\" --- apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2 kind: InitConfiguration nodeRegistration: criSocket: \"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\" To bootstrap the cluster, execute: ./kubeadm init --upload-certs --cri-socket \"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\" --config conf.yaml Then, get the calico setup from here. In the yaml set the pod CIDR: - name: CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR value: \"172.16.0.0/16\" To configure the inter-node pod communication, I followed these steps here. Before applying I recommend to set up VXLAN instead of ipip mode (see below). By default, calico uses ipip tunneling for pod communication. A tunnel is a virtual network interface to connect subnets. This did not work in my Azure network. Instead, I configured VXLAN. cat vxlan.yaml apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1 kind: IPPool metadata: name: ippool-vxlan-1 spec: cidr: 172.16.0.0/16 vxlanMode: Always natOutgoing: true Traffic to the pod network (outside the node) should then not be routed to tunl0 anymore: ip a 4: tunl0@NONE: \u003cNOARP,UP,LOWER_UP\u003e mtu 1480 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link/ipip 0.0.0.0 brd 0.0.0.0 Install calioctl and verify that there is only one ippool: calicoctl get ippools If not, delete the other pool: calicoctl delete pool default-ipv4-ippool You need to reboot, to force a reassignment of the pod IPs to the new network. Then doublecheck that the the CIDR did not change: kubectl get ipamblocks.crd.projectcalico.org \\-o jsonpath=\"{range .items[*]}{'podNetwork: '}{.spec.cidr}{'\\t NodeIP: '}{.spec.affinity}{'\\n'}\" Otherwise, you need to update the Azure routing table!

Outside it‚Äôs main application domain, the platform also appeals to the High Performance Computing (HPC) community for that infrastructure management can be delegated to cloud providers and it‚Äôs on-demand scaling. The challenge is that HPC jobs are usually long running and stateful. Jobs such as simulations or optimization problems usually keep their state in memory and state checkpointing on disk is not always available. This is undesirable because failures are expected to occur. Matters becomes even worse for jobs with unpredictable resource requirements. Unexpected spikes in memory can lead to out-of-memory node situations, which results in pods being killed. The catastrophic consequence is the complete loss of job progress from many hours or even days of compute time. To avoid this, a migration of stateful pods to another node would be desirable.

Since I was little, I felt attracted to the country: the people, the language and the weather. Barcelona was an obvious choice after falling in love with the city and making a good friend there in 2018. I wanted to take these months for exploration and self discovery.

After living alone for more than a year, I got to enjoy the solitude, but it was interesting to live in a more lively environment. Living under the same roof with someone provides a deep view into how they live and deal with all kinds of daily situations. As a result, I adopted some of their behaviors - some intentionally, some unconsciously. Two of my roommates are a couple and I liked how openly they would discuss their worries and feelings. I come from a family where we did not share much personal feelings, so I tend to choke them up, but my roomie told me how good it feels to vent off and not let problems accumulate.

I already mostly avoided meat before (for health and ethical reasons) but consumed lots of dairies, eggs etc. My friend raised my awareness for how I equally support industrial livestock farming with those animal products, just like meat.

It‚Äôs challenging because there is no one to keep you responsible and motivated. On the other hand, finishing a project pushes the confidence in one‚Äôs own skills and seeing people star the project, because they might potentially find it useful, feels great. My biggest project was my personal search engine misou. It started as a Hackathon project with some friends from uni and I continued working on it to practice and make it usable. On the side, I was reading O‚Äôreilly literature on TDD, polished up on Typescript and React and enjoyed how I could bring into practice in my project without excuses (dirty legacy code..). With a classmate, I solved a small kata to practice TDD and get to know Svelte. It was really fun but also instructive to see the others perspective. I also developed a little blog CLI which is super useful to me and forked a personal CRM to my needs.

I took my first bachata course and went on a salsa congress. I made progress in my style, but I realized that I need a regular dancing partner to practice outside classes. Consolidating new figuras in memory takes more than one class, but unless I feel good about them I won‚Äôt incorporate them into social dance.

I‚Äôm late in the game, but I want to share my goals for this year with you. I started with it last year and I found them helpful to focus my energy and time. Every week, I checked my progress in my weekly review. All in all, I am satisfied because I reached the important goals and learnt more about my capacity. Most of my goals were habit building ones like: meditate daily, do exercise bidaily, go to bed before 10:30 pm, journal daily, read 10 books.. But there is still much to be improved upon. I defined too many goals and did not did not prioritize accordingly. Also, I want to remind myself more often of them, so I will make a pinned note on my desktop and phone (thanks to thesephist for the idea).

In the past, I easily got caught up with what is important in the moment and invested all effort into it. But I became a believer of the 80/20 rule and want to invest not only in the urgent but also in the important (Eisenhower matrix). I want to take time in the morning to learn what I believe important and listen more to technical podcasts. I already discovered a lot of tools and resources through it last year: Learning Golang with TDD (my fav), Wails, Svelte, vim tricks‚Ä¶ And it broadens my horizon on topics I‚Äôve never heard about like BPFs for Observability of microservices and compiler development in the old days.. So exposing myself to new input is one part and the second is to get my own hands dirty to really learn. This can mean solving exercises / following a learning project or applying the new tool / language in my own little project.

I love to get to know new people and exchange on interests. Jordan Harbinger got me intrigued with his Networking course !! to be more intentional about network building. It happened only a few times to me until now, but it‚Äôs gratifying to help a friend through some connection. But while calls are great to exchange on technical stuff, it‚Äôs not the same as hanging out with a friend. I guess I‚Äôm not the exception, but I just connect much better with people emotionally in person. Unfortunately, many of my friends live in other cities or even countries. In the past, I did not make enough effort to visit because I mistook digitally staying in touch to be enough. This year, I plan to visit more close but far-away friends. But getting back to the intro, I also want to host gatherings with friends to connect and make space for good conversations. I was very humble to keep the number to two, because of my current living situation (not having an own home + switching places) but for me it‚Äôs most important to start doing it at all. I like to be proactive and I want to learn to become a good host. This also applies to technical activities. Last year, I started the clean-code challenge with a friend, invited a friend to solve a coding kata together, initiated to go on a hackathon with some friends, but I want to grow these activities in size and quantity.

Being a good listener, asking curious questions is all great, but I want to be more dynamic in groups. However, most of my hobbies are not fun to show (writing, meditation, swimming‚Ä¶). Last year, I found storytelling, re-read ‚ÄúSurely You‚Äôre Joking, Mr. Feynman!‚Äù (highly recommended) and got inspired to be more curious in exploring random interests. In the case of Feynman it was opening locks, solving puzzles, playing tricks, very random observations that challenged his friends to conduct a fun experiment.. Yeah, he was an intriguing guy.. This year, I want to explore two random interests. Candidates are storytelling (e.g. join toastmasters..), learning magic tricks, learning the ukulele..

I fucked up in nearly all possible ways and it taught me many lessons. First, I bought it on eBay Kleinanzeigen from a nice guy who even gave me a discount as a student and I had a nice chat with him when picking it up. He quickly showed me that it was working (turned it on) and I blindly believed that everything would be good; that is what the description said and the guy was trustworthy! When at home, I quickly found out that the battery had a defect. I don‚Äôt think that the owner mischievously lied to me, because after some discussions he later generously agreed to give a discount or help with repair. But it was my responsibility to make a careful check (battery, display, keyboard, touchpad, internet, ports). A few weeks later on a windy day, I went outside to study and opened it on a table. For one second I did not hold it and the next moment my beautiful MacBook Air flew through the air. It was a quick gust and after a few meters it crashed on the rough floor. I already expected the worst, but it was still fully working. Nevertheless, but it got some ugly scratches and deformations. How was I so mindless not putting one and one together on such a windy day? This is not yet the end. Later, I decided to buy a cheap battery on eBay to replace it together with my dad. Paying Apple 140 Euros for the repair just seemed like a big rip-off to me! The replacement was quite fiddly and when connecting the new battery, the CPU suddenly got hot and it started smoking. My dad even got a slight burn. Now, the MacBook was completely dead. How could this have gone much worse? The moral of the story is to be more averse of big risks. A big second-hand purchase should be carefully checked. People might not have bad intents, but I am responsible for everything that might be discovered afterwards. Secondly, it‚Äôs not worth to risk a big loss to save a few bucks because it might turn out much more expensive.

I had been seeing it during my stay in China and I largely avoided it, because I wanted the ‚ÄúChina experience‚Äù. I‚Äôd say I succeeded because I tried to hang out with Chinese whenever possible, but nevertheless most of my friends were internationals. However, I somehow failed to transfer this observation to my next exchange. I took the wrong conclusion from the observation that it is easier to connect with Spanish people because we are culturally closer. The first day I arrived on the campus in Barcelona, I ignored the compatriots behind my back that were getting to know each other. I ignored all Erasmus welcoming activities, because I wanted to make Spanish friends. And while I was disappointed to see that there was no canteen to talk to new faces during lunch, I still believed that there would be plenty of opportunities through uni associations, sports, classes, parties. As it turned out though, the activities at my uni were very counted (or I missed the secret channel ^^). Dancing was another prospect, but in the end I could count the total number of peers with my fingers. I also made a few intents approaching people on campus, but of course they mostly spoke Catalan. I did not expect it, but it made me feel a bit like an outsider. I guess it taught me that I would not want to live in a place whose local language I would not speak (or plan to learn). I regret not having participated at the welcoming events. I learnt that I need to seize opportunities in the moment, to not bet on later chances because they might not come. It was a missed chance with not much to lose.

Short disclaimer: that was a stupid thought. Last year,I was finally abroad and not so much loaded with uni and work. Besides it would be cheaper here in Spain - perfect timing. But my first mistake was not to inform well on the local circumstances. I knew I would need a NIE document and even checked the official website, but it just said no appointments available at the moment. I thought: ‚Äúoh well COVID‚Äù, it will hopefully change when I am there and there will be a way.. After quite some effort to get an officer on the phone, I found out that this is the default display because the few new appointments are immediately snatched away. For weeks I tried to get an appointment by constantly refreshing the page, booked one in a far away city, but all in vain. It was hopeless. I finally got one through a bot from a dude on Github - that‚Äôs how insane the situation is. Paying the NIE fee was a whole different story.. Before, I went to many driving schools to ask for the required documents and all replied that I‚Äôd be fine with the NIE. Long story short, it was unrealistic to complete it in Barcelona and after finding a school in another city they found out that I‚Äôd need to proof 6 months of residency in Spain. After all the efforts, it failed on this. Had I done my research early (to my defense, it was not pointed out on all websites) or contacted the authorities directly, I could have saved all this wasted time. My takeaway: Get the information early, before investing much effort. Otherwise you are irrationally inclined to pursue it no matter the cost. Secondly, get information either directly from the source (authorities) or google experiences from others. I received much misinformation from the driving schools and even banks..

There should be a clear distinction between operation and integration (also see Integration Operation Segregation Principle). Each small unit should be independent, i.e. unaware of the other parts in the composition. Mocking is required when our decomposition strategy has failed, Eric Elliott ","date":"2021-11-24","objectID":"/posts/js-testing/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"Testable code has few mocks","uri":"/posts/js-testing/"},{"categories":["Programming"],"content":"Function composition What was new to me is that composing functions do not need to be unit tested when they are truly independent. Because in such case we can use a generic composition utility. Let‚Äôs look at an example1. The imperative and obvious solution to integrate is this: // Imperative composition const composition = (x) =\u003e { const afterG = g(x); const afterF = f(afterG); return afterF; }; In languages without first-class functions, there might be no way around this. But in most popular languages, such as JavaScript, you can do better. Function composition is declarative and avoids bugs such as passing or returning the wrong variable. For the declarative composition, you can either define your own pipe (which could be error-prone) or use a library1: // import pipe from 'lodash/fp/flow'; const pipe = (...fns) =\u003e x =\u003e fns.reduce((y, f) =\u003e f(y), x); // Functions to compose const g = n =\u003e n + 1; const f = n =\u003e n * 2; // Declarative composition const doStuffBetter = pipe(g, f); doStuffBetter(20), // 42 Note that reduce applies the accumulator on each value from left to right! There is also a reverse variant called reduceRight. This reduction would have given 41 as result. Commonly, we have asynchronous calls in our code, but we can also compose promises! I think this is also where it really pays off - when you compose calls with side effects. Unit testing the integration function becomes tedious, because we need to stub all participants1: // imperative async function uploadFiles({ user, folder, files }) { const dbUser = await readUser({ user }); const folderInfo = await getFolderInfo({ folder }); if (await haveWriteAccess({ dbUser, folderInfo })) { return uploadToFolder({ dbUser, folderInfo, files }); } else { throw new Error(\"No write access to that folder\"); } } // declarative const asyncPipe = (...fns) =\u003e (x) =\u003e fns.reduce(async (y, f) =\u003e f(await y), x); const uploadFiles = asyncPipe( readUser, getFolderInfo, haveWriteAccess, uploadToFolder ); uploadFiles({ user, folder, files }).then(log); As you see, the declarative uploadFiles function is just a function call - no logic to be tested! The correctness of the step order is not assured, but in most cases this is covered in integration tests. If it‚Äôs complex logic, you might still write a unit test to test the correct step order of the composition. I agree that the declarative implementation (asyncPipe) is more difficult to understand at first, but it is less error prone and more concise. asyncPipe is given an array of functions that it reduces. y is the previous result and we apply f on it‚Äôs result. The second return value x is the initial value. This syntax confused me a bit, but the initial value obviously needs to be provided at some place. This is functional programming!

Moreover, it leaves less room for bugs, because you only declare what you want to perform instead of how to do it (imperative). However, it‚Äôs not possible to only rely on functional programming, because applications are stateful and have side effects (network requests, file operations, logging‚Ä¶). A good strategy is to keep the business logic functional and move side effects to the outer boundary. Let‚Äôs consider the example of an online shop that decides to give some premium benefits to its loyal customers. Premium customers might benefit from special discounts and free shipping so we want to update their status in the database. On the other hand, we might want to reach out to the inactive customers. The status of our customer is clearly business logic and it should not be mixed with database logic. One approach would be to pass a database interface and mock it in the test. function updateCustomer(today,entry,db) { if(isLoyalCustomer(today,entry.date)){ newEntry = {premium: true, ...entry} db.UpdateEntry(newEntry) } if(isInactiveCustomer(today,entry.date){ newEntry = {inactive: true, ...entry} return db.UpdateEntry(newEntry) }) } But there is a better approach that is declarative and easier to test: function updateCustomer(today,entry) { if(isLoyalCustomer(today,entry.date)){ newEntry = {premium: true, ...entry} return new FileUpdate(newEntry) } if(isInactiveCustomer(today,entry.date){ newEntry = {inactive: true, ...entry} return new FileUpdate(newEntry) }) return new NoUpdate(entry) } It‚Äôs clearer in the intent that the output is a return value instead of an input value with side effects. Also, there is no need to mock! Of course there is still a missing piece for this variant - the mutable shell that applies the side effects. In our case, there would be a Persister, which is a database wrapper that reads the update instructions. It‚Äôs correctness would be covered in the integration test.

But think what exactly needs to be tested. For testing the request handler of our express app, it‚Äôs not necessary to create a mockserver. We only want to test the handler logic. Express logic to create the server with port allocation etc. does not need to be tested by us! I find the distinction between handlers and servers especially clear in Golang: handler := newHelloHandler() request := newRequest(\"Floyd\") response := httptest.NewRecorder() handler.ServeHTTP(response, request) assertStatus(t, response.Code, http.StatusOK) assertResponseBody(t, response.Body.String(), \"Hello Floyd\") The handler object includes all logic how to process requests, so we can use it to test the correct behavior. Note how only the response needs to be mocked (spied to be precise). In Express.js, we do the same. We test the handler function and spy the response object. const helloHandler = (req, res) =\u003e res.send('Hello World!'); const expected = 'Hello World!'; const resSpy = { send: (actual) =\u003e assert.Equal(actual,expected) } hello({}, resSpy); The request handler is at the outer layer of our application, i.e. it connects with external dependencies to cause side effects. In our case the external dependency is the response object which makes a network call. In that case it is justified and necessary to mock. The general guideline is to only mock external dependencies.

Functional code is easy to test and allows to use function composition. This reduces the surface for bugs and saves us to write unit tests for integration functions.

By rewinding the small beautiful moments, we can also become more appreciative of our dearest and loved ones. Journaling can take different forms, be it asking yourself a couple of simple questions or long streamlining of thoughts (brain dump). But to start a habit it‚Äôs best to keep it simple. Honestly, it even took me some time to get valuable answers to simple questions like ‚ÄúWhat are you grateful for?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat would make today great?‚Äù. I was just not used to asking this. Yet, I believe it‚Äôs very meaningful because it sets your intention for the day.

We are all born within this frame, but over time we all have different experiences. More importantly, those experiences shape how we interpret and understand the world. While growing up, we see how our characters and mindsets diverge from those that were so similar to us back in the early school days. Once we leave our home to explore other cultures we see the diversity of lifestyles. What unites us is the desire to have a happy life. What differentiate us is the intepretation of how to attain it.

Religion is a powerful mental model on how to see the world, but even it is only a part of our identity. Just look to see how different the lifestyle of an ostentatious Sheik in Dubai is to that of the geographically close average co-religionist in Iran. The living-circumstances are totally different of course, but how they choose to live is driven by values. After all, there are frugal millionaires who stick to a modest lifestyle (take Ronald Read)!

My friends birthday is approaching, so do I reserve time to think about how to surprise her? I want to become financially independent? Do I review my spendings and allocate enough savings to long term investments? Do I review my portfolio to reallocate according to my risk and diversify enough? I want to live healthy? So, I reserve time to go to the gym and explore new healthy recipes. My life areas include: professional ones like my job, university and coding, in which I want to learn new skills and apply them to side projects. My leisure areas include: reading, my blog, language learning, finance, health (exercise, meditation) and exploration. The last one I defined for myself lately with the desire to try out more new things. It includes planning adventures, travels, etc., but also learning completely new skills in a short time.

However, there is still one more crucial step missing. We might decide to build that new cool app, or organize that crazy suprise party, but these are big projects that can be intimidating. Much anxiety and procrastination comes from not having clear what to do next. And this even applies to much smaller undertakings such as writing an article. I find it helpful to view every undertaking that takes me more than a couple of minutes as a project (for more check Getting Things Done). The big projects then needs to be broken up into actionable items. In fact, its even enough to define the next tiny step toward progress. The first step for the surprise party might be calling a friend to ask for help or brainstorming ideas. At this point you have translated the abstract life area concept into a concrete action. If you plan your days with actionable items, you know exactly what to do and can stay away from external distractions. This gives you a sense of control over your life - you are the steersman with a clear heading, robust to the roaring sea. And other than money or fame, the feeling of control seems to be the univeral fuel of happiness: More than your salary. More than the size of your house. More than the prestige of your job. Control over doing what you want, when you want to, with the people you want to, is the broadest lifestyle variable that makes people happy. ‚Äì The Psychology of Money, Morgan Housel ","date":"2021-10-11","objectID":"/posts/mental-models/:0:5","tags":null,"title":"Mental Models - How they contribute to a happy life","uri":"/posts/mental-models/"},{"categories":["Thoughts"],"content":"You want more?

You might even invent it: I like it, but my wife says it‚Äôs not worth more than x.. I need to consult with my manager.. Even the president does it, referring to the power of the senate.. It wins empathy that you are not the one making strong claims. To avoid the partner from applying the trick of higher power delegation, ask early if there is a higher power: If that‚Äôs the perfect house, could you make a decision today? Try to negotiate asap with the person in charge. Scarcity makes things more attractive: The bus in Ghana always has only one seat left until the next actor gives up a place. Same for ‚Äúlast offer‚Äù. Scrutinize if the scarcity is real. Never indicate a selling price as negotiable. This shows that you don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs worth this price. Build up a connection before talking about business. When your friendliness clashes with your extreme business goals, the other experiences cognitive dissonance, which they try to harmonize (similar to Stockholm syndrome). Consistency principle: explore principles or the slogan of the other and use them to make claims: The flyer guarantees freshness, it doesn‚Äôt mention any exclusion close to final hour. When the police stops you, keep them from writing something down through questions and explanations. As soon as he writes it down, he will file the claim due to consistency (show no weakness). Deadlines are often made up to push us to a deal. The phony trick: when wanting to buy something, let people you know make very low offers and then make a slightly higher bet. Your low offer will appear high compared to the others. Be wary of the good-guy bad-guy trick. The good guy tries to win your empathy by protecting you from the outrageous claims from the bad guy. If detected, mention it: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen such a good cop bad cop play‚Äù.. Sound reasonable by bringing objective measures in to play. Before making the other aware of the consequences, ask them if they accept the criteria: ‚ÄúDo you find it reasonable to compare prices to be fair?‚Äù. People prefer distributed wins (finding 2x 10 Euros vs 1x 20 Euros), but losing at once. Chunk advantages and perks to make them seem more. Humans have a strong sense of fairness and even reject deals that are beneficial for them. The absolute price limit can be detected by ever decreasing concessions. Framing: Put arguments that correspond to the others view. If your boss wants to hire the best, argue how an assistant would give more time to focus on the core work. If he wants to save money, argue how it would stop the expensive work force from spending time doing paper work and copying. Overcommitment phenomenon: After a big time investment, we are eager for closing a deal. Don‚Äôt consider sunken cost, but always consider if the deal makes sense. Be wary of low balling: negatives are presented very late. On the other hand, you can use it to negotiate a better deal. Ask the other GRADUALLY for documents, information..

We often mistake that what we know and perceive, is also what the other feels: Only few people can detect songs that the other knocks on the table. The knocker cannot believe how the other cannot hear it. This also applies to partners who know each other for years. It‚Äôs helpful to assume the position of the other to understand the situation better. E.g: examine the position of the accused when you defend your client. We tend to be overconfident about our own position, and the role reversal reveals our weaknesses.

You can use an external monitor for the documentation or separate windows on a large enough screen. The time frame is short, so you might skip low percentage questions (2-3 %) and do them last. Moreover, shortcuts can help you save time: Use the CLI as much as possible to get the boilerplate for the yaml files. kubectl run / create are your friends! Configure your bashsrc: vim ~/.bashsrc // add: alias k=kubectl alias kaf='k apply -f' alias kcn='kubectl config set-context --current --namespace' export d=\"--dry-run=client -o yaml\" source \u003c(kubectl completion bash) complete -F __start_kubectl k `` This shortens the syntax and adds bash completion. To get the boilerplate for a pod manifest, you can then simply type k run mypod --image myimage $do \u003e pod.yaml Be careful, you might have to install bash-completion before: sudo apt-get install bash-completion Configure vim: Vim ~/.vimrc // add: set tabstop=2 // set tabbing to 2 spaces set shiftwidth=2 // apply tab on multiple lines set expandtab // use spaces for tabs `` For debugging, it might also be useful to enable the line numbering: :set number Optional: Tmux for multiple terminals I found the kubectl explain command quite convenient to quickly check the API, while I was writing the yaml file. For this it is however necessary two have 2 terminals. Tmux has different behavior (copying, scrolling ‚Ä¶), so be sure to be familiar with it if you want to use it in the exam. All commands inside tmux are prepended with Ctrl+b, so I omit that in the following. tmux // inside tmux: :set -g mouse on // scroll and click with mouse ‚Äú // split terminal vertically % // or split horizontally For navigation, I used these commands: ]¬†// paste clipboard ; // toggle last used window [ // activate scroll x // kill current pane \u0026 // kill session d // detach // in the terminal: tmux attach Finally, as with most things, it is about practicing and you can find some practicing questions on Google, such as these 150 questions.

Organization and structure are crucial for this system to work, even more than content collection. I can tell from past experience of dead archives that I had long forgotten about their existence. But even worse, file corpses can make it harder to find what we want. In order to overcome this problem, I experimented with a file structure system called PARA, invented by Tiago Forte.

Dynamic means, that current projects are stored in a quickly accessible Project folder and are archived once finished. This sounds trivial, but most people organize files like in a library. A job application draft is hence likely to end up in a file hierarchy like User/Uni/Applications/Interns/Company/.... But given that moving files on a computer is not as tedious, as moving books in a library and that projects have personal context, the dynamic approach in GTD has some benefits. The application document is not just a file with information (like the book), but it is a project that has a deadline and needs many sub-actions (research position and company, write motivation letter, update CV‚Ä¶). It is hence handy to have a central overview of all projects and respective material in a dedicated folder. And in that project folder I only want all the files that are relevant, and not have it mixed among other old applications and unrelated reference material. The latter might still be useful, but it probably just obscures your path to the important documents for the project. This is why PARA distinguishes between actionable items (Projects) and reference material (Resources) at the highest folder level. If you want to read more about the benefits of PARA, I recommend the blog posts from the creator. In the following, I want to share what worked for me after about 8 months of usage. Many people struggle to distinguish the categories and are unsure where to place their files. This also happened to me and I hope that this post can help to clarify it a bit. The author recommends using the system cross-platform for consistency, but I must admit that the structure only made sense to me in the cloud drive and my Notion planner. Not all categories persisted, but those that did, proved valuable.

But it still happens that there also exists a folder such as Finance and this is where many people (including me) get confused in the beginning. Should I place my file into Areas or Resources? Or even more important, where did I put it? For me, I distinguish them according to importance. My Areas include important file that I really need (mostly because they are official documents). My resources include reference material, which wouldn‚Äôt be a catastrophe if I‚Äôd somehow lose it. In this sense it is really just an add-on for me which allows me to access non-essential files later, without cluttering up my other directories. Because it is not essential, I realized that I also tend to forget about what is inside, which makes it a bit futile right? I believe that the best way to make good use of the resources is to review and potentially clean them monthly. But as always, only keep what serves you.

Also, VIM is absolutely worth learning if you don‚Äôt intend to use the terminal program!

It‚Äôs most well known among programmers for its powerful features to navigate and edit code. VIM users belief that it‚Äôs much smoother to just use the keyboard instead of navigating with a mouse. But besides speed, it is also more ergonomic to rely on the keyboard (you probably heard of the mouse arm, or at least german folks say so)! At the same time it‚Äôs maybe also the most frustrating text editor for first time users - yes, the most frequent google searches are ‚ÄúHow to edit / exit vim?‚Äù. Being said that the learning curve is rather steep, the reward is deferred until you perform your first edit magic with a few keystrokes! Short disclaimer, I will not show you the basics (which the linked resources below do much better than I could), but I will show you some examples that demonstrate its power and elegance. The only thing you need to know is that VIM has a normal mode and an insert mode. The insert mode is for adding content and the normal mode is for editing and navigating code - what we actually spend most time on. Therefore, it‚Äôs also the default mode when you open VIM. This is where newbies get confused when they type and apparently nothing happens üò§‚å®Ô∏è . What is not clear is that their input are VIM commands which most likely do nothing in an empty document. With this in mind, we can now dive into the examples.

Better than fiddling with the mouse, isn‚Äôt it? Ok, that was simple. How about something super related to Javascript, C++ programmers - the missing braces.

Let‚Äôs say, you want to change the values of an array to increasing numbers (1, 2, 3‚Ä¶ 10) - without for loops. The classical approach would probably be typing the first statement my_array[0] = 1;, copying the line with the mouse, pasting it a couple of times, and then clicking on each index and value to change it ‚Äî Puuh, this will take you around a minute I guess. In VIM, you only type the first line. Then you type yy10Pww^v10jg^a (^ - Ctrl-key). This looks like madness written out, but trust me - there is logic behind this ü§ì You don‚Äôt need to follow this right now, but in case you are curious: yy copies the entire line, 10P pastes the line ten times above the cursor, ww jumps the cursor two words ahead, ^v goes into block-wise visual mode (similar to how you select with the mouse), 10j selects the next 10 lines g^a increases the selection as desired. These few strokes then result in this: my_array[1] = 1; my_array[2] = 1; my_array[3] = 1; my_array[4] = 1; my_array[5] = 1; my_array[6] = 1; my_array[7] = 1; my_array[8] = 1; my_array[9] = 1; my_array[10] = 1; my_array[11] = 1; , and with very few more keystrokes, we can also increase all the 1s without ever touching the mouse. This of course, also works for similar scenarios where you want to increment all selected numbers by a desired step size, decrement etc. It‚Äôs probably not a situation you need to deal with daily, but I think it serves to show that you can also do sophisticated actions with VIM. And it‚Äôs very configurable. Most VIMers adjust the profiles to what is useful to them and share their config on the internet.

Taking risks makes success more likely and failures are normal. But never risk failures that could destroy you completely. Also invest during bear market (time is your best friend ).

Growing up in a bull market vs depression. Compound effects are extreme and are the key factor for Warren buffets success. The key is to maintain assets for them to grow over time. It‚Äôs the tails who make the big gains. Consistently invest also during bear market. The reasonable wins over the rational strategy because you are more likely to persist with the former. Theoretically best to invest with 50 debt ratio in early years, including bear market, but take the option you sleep well with. It‚Äôs a fallacy to believe that we remain the person we are right now. Therefore, it‚Äôs good to save without knowing for what. Don‚Äôt worry about sunk cost, it‚Äôs about the future and not past efforts. Don‚Äôt go for extremes and bet on a bright future. The price of a stock depends on your time horizon. Do you want to sell in a year, in a decade? Humans are risk averse. Therefore, pessimistic news gain more attention. Whereas huge successes such as a big company growth in a few months may go unnoticed We warp reality around our beliefs / wishes. If we believe that a recession is about to come, we take every sign as a confirmation, although there might be nothing behind it.. We are less critical in that situation. Risk is what is left when you think you have thought of everything. We don‚Äôt tend to accept the complexity of the world, but rather make the world fit our narrative. We need to come to terms with how much is out of our control Define the rules by which you play and make sure you don‚Äôt follow others who have different rules / goals. Bubble speculators‚Ä¶ Independence is the highest goal. It‚Äôs about keeping expectations low to save enough. Make decisions you feel good with. It is not rational to pay a house when interest rates are low, but it gives you the feeling of liberty. Same for cash. Keep a money reserve to decrease the likelihood to sell stocks for big investment.

A good system ensures persistence. Pick habits and rules that are aligned with your strengths. Do what‚Äôs easy. Ingredients for Habit formation: Cue (Make it Obvious vs Invisible): put cues to remind you of doing it. Create an environment with positive cues: Put healthy food at the front. Put book on my pillow. Put yoga mattress on the floor. Craving (Make it Attractive vs Unattractive): anything unattractive costs willpower which is limited. Routine (Make it Easy vs Difficult): Make a new habit take up less than 2 minutes. Make it a ritual and not look like a chore. Stop before it feels like work. Increase friction for negative habits. Habit formation is about frequency, not time. Create a routine while doing something positive and enjoyable. After a while the routine becomes associated with this mood, so you can induce it by doing the routine. E.g.: Put on headphones (=focus time) to study Reward (Make it Satisfying vs Unsatisfying): behaviors that are immediately rewarded get repeated, those that are punished don‚Äôt. The reward comes from the anticipation of the action, not the action itself. ‚Üí Use, existing pleasant habits and add to them a new wanted habit.

After all, we spend a considerable amount of time doing it. It might be to research something specific, to learn something new, or simply to entertain ourselves. The internet provides a rich resource of information, but it‚Äôs probably also the most distracting source. We might start the browser to check some specific information, but as we go, we find another article on the side that catches our attention. It sounds too interesting to dismiss! The article might link to an exciting video on youtube. Of course, we want to see it, and it only takes 2 minutes after all! But once you are on youtube, you probably all know how easy it is to get in an open-loop. Our initial search to look up information on having a pet might eventually end with kitten videos on youtube (and they can go even much further..). Yes, they are cute, but is it helpful to decide at this moment? I know this example is very contrived and ridiculous, but surely most of us regularly get into these open loops. And for me, this situation was also tricky. On the one hand, I didn‚Äôt want to dismiss interesting articles, but I also felt conscience-stricken about getting distracted by content that is not relevant at this moment. Of course, there are easy ways around this. Some use bookmarks, and others like to keep 50+ tabs open in their browser (I was astounded when I saw this!).

In fact, platforms are designed to take us into this open-loop trap of consumption. That‚Äôs good for their success, but do you want this? Having a dedicated place to store and the mindset of content collection helped me escape the open-loops more often. Also, I didn‚Äôt particularly like cluttering my bookmarks, intended for quickly accessing frequently visited websites, with specific content I want to checkout (this list can grow quickly..). Now, I can read whenever I want to and also don‚Äôt miss out on good content. Easily find what you want I like to save my content in categories. The Check-Later app lets me choose a topic and get access to all the related resources. What makes this better than bookmarks is that you have a keyword search that checks all your articles‚Äô content - very neat! Also, I can archive articles after having read them and still access them later through search. More selective content choices Whenever I see something that catches my attention now, I think twice if I really want to consume this. For once, it takes slightly more effort than just clicking on the link (so lazy, I know). Secondly, I know that it will have to compete with all the other appealing stuff on my list. Knowledge conservation Besides the benefit of quickly retrieving old content, it also provides the ability to store highlights of articles and attach notes. It is then possible to extract your highlights and notes and review them. I‚Äôm forgetful of details, and statistics show that the majority does, so I like to be reminded of interesting ideas. Also, I like how these old ideas connect with others and expand.

For developers, it also provides an Open API (I might try this in the future). Compared to its close competitor, Pocket, its premium version is also significantly cheaper ($29.99/year ~‚Ç¨23). Pocket Its basic principle is very similar to Instapaper but provides slightly more functionality (tags, text to speech..). The free version is limited to 3 highlights per article (which I find very restrictive) and doesn‚Äôt include a full-text search. Its premium version is ‚Ç¨39.99/year. Raindrop.io It‚Äôs the closest option to the classical bookmark manager but is much more attractive and powerful. You can organize links in folders, attach tags, and it has a beautiful interface.

Be aware, however, that it doesn‚Äôt support text highlighting nor note-taking.

According to your preferences, it provides five selected highlights per day as part of spaced repetition. Simply put, it is the Anki version for what you read. You can also include gaps in the highlight or reformulate it as a question to trigger your memory. The premium version even supports export to Evernote \u0026 Notion. You can connect it to a wide variety of services such as Instapaper and Pocket, but it also supports Twitter, Kindle, PDF import, Airr (currently iOS only, but great for highlighting in Podcasts), and many more. This app is, however, not free and distinguishes between a Lite version ($4.49 billed annually or $4.99 billed monthly) and the full version ($7.99 billed annually or $8.99 billed monthly). Students also enjoy a 50% discount. I agree that this is quite some money for the basic functionality to review your highlights, and I still have to figure out if it‚Äôs worth the price for me. However, it provides a free month trial for everyone, and the invitation system puts an extra free month on top. So I think it‚Äôs worth giving it a shot. If you want to try it out, you are welcome to use my referral link, which grants both of us an extra free month. It would also be interesting for me to hear your opinion on it!

Databases One feature I started to appreciate a lot after some time is databases. When you create a new page, you can decide between a table, kanban board, calendar, etc. But they are all essentially databases which just differ in their visualization. So if you later find that your initial table might be much better represented as a nice gallery, that is possible with a click. What I especially appreciate about them is their relations.

But it‚Äôs only when you stop and think of your work through this new perspective, that you actually jump up and go turn the idea into reality. That‚Äôs the real inspiration that everyone is looking for. ‚Äì Derek Sivers In the upcoming posts, I want to give some practical insights on how I applied these techniques to my life. But to get something useful from it, you will have to apply it to your life!

Who doesn‚Äôt know it, after having an initial spark on how to solve a problem, it is tentative to immediately start coding. I guess most of us did so initially and almost always ended up on dead-end roads. Taking the time to think a design through before writing the first line is indispensable for larger projects but even makes things easier for smaller undertakings. Object-oriented programming is a very common and powerful paradigm to write code. The patterns I refer to are based on this principle and give guidelines on how to design classes and interfaces. The main motivation for these patterns is code reusability and easier maintenance. Code shouldn‚Äôt break after adjusting a single line. Also, extending the functionality shouldn‚Äôt need a big refactor.

Don‚Äôt try to reinvent the wheel: Design patterns are tested and tried solutions, so they are probably useful for you too. It‚Äôs a universal toolkit: They are motivated by general principles and allow you to think and frame problems in new ways. They help to see the bigger picture by abstracting the problem specifics. Understand other code more easily: The recognition of patterns can help read other code. Patterns encipher intent, so it might reveal why code was designed that way. A way to communicate design ideas concisely.: Using a common language can simplify communication among developers. This is what lingo should be used for: precise communication of complex ideas.

It doesn‚Äôt remain abstract but instead tries to relate it to practice. I found the real-world analogies to the patterns sometimes quite amusing. Moreover, the book has a clear structure for each design. It starts with a problem that the pattern addresses. The pattern structure is explained (with UML diagram), and pseudo-code is given. Moreover, the book comes with source code for solutions in several common languages (Python, C++, Go, Java, Swift‚Ä¶). It not only mentions when to use it but also when to not use it. Finally, the relationship with other patterns is laid out. This is useful to distinguish patterns with a similar structure, but it also mentions how they might be combined.

Each day, I read about two to three patterns. I then went through a source-code implementation to understand the language‚Äôs specifics and make the constructs more relatable. I focused on Python but always glimpsed at the Go solution to learn about its language specialties. Also, the author of the Go solutions was a bit more creative with the hypothetical problems :) After that, I thought about a problem by myself and how I could apply the pattern. I then implemented a sketchy solution in Python. This was definitely the most time-intensive part, but I believe that it is crucial for learning. Tell me and I forget, teach me and I remember, involve me and I learn. Sidenote: If you want to learn more about the origin of this Confucian wisdom, check here.
