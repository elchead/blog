Negotiation is an art and has many more dimensions than just the price. It revealed to me that being prepared with many variations of offers is a good way to find a deal that suits both. I noticed that I lost lots of potential in the past by easily giving away things that are not very important to me, instead of using them as a leverage. Moreover, I want to try out how accompanying a complaint with a satisfying solution is more effective. I want to question my discontent more. It‚Äôs probably not the action, but my interpretation that bugs me. To clear it up, I first state the facts to the other and then how I feel about it. I then ask about how they see it.

Ask questions, you will be surprised how willing people are to share information. Who can decide to negotiate? What offer do I get when I buy this as well? Ask the big stuff early.

Avoid disagreeing about negative points(e.g. you are expensive), but instead agree and provide a reason for it: Yes, and surely you value quality and service.

Don‚Äôt be as vague as trying to haggle as much as possible! Negotiate with your favorite option last, when you had the chance to negotiate a proper fallback option. Never lament.

A compromise is not win win, but lose lose. Most likely there is a way to find a solution where no one needs to give up on what they value. Don‚Äôt focus too much on the price. There are many more non monetary values which might be of high value for you and cheap for the other. E.g hotel reservation: breakfast and spa is cheap for them, but very nice for you.

You might even invent it: I like it, but my wife says it‚Äôs not worth more than x.. I need to consult with my manager.. Even the president does it, referring to the power of the senate.. It wins empathy that you are not the one making strong claims. To avoid the partner from applying the trick of higher power delegation, ask early if there is a higher power: If that‚Äôs the perfect house, could you make a decision today? Try to negotiate asap with the person in charge. Scarcity makes things more attractive: The bus in Ghana always has only one seat left until the next actor gives up a place. Same for ‚Äúlast offer‚Äù. Scrutinize if the scarcity is real. Never indicate a selling price as negotiable. This shows that you don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs worth this price. Build up a connection before talking about business. When your friendliness clashes with your extreme business goals, the other experiences cognitive dissonance, which they try to harmonize (similar to Stockholm syndrome). Consistency principle: explore principles or the slogan of the other and use them to make claims: The flyer guarantees freshness, it doesn‚Äôt mention any exclusion close to final hour. When the police stops you, keep them from writing something down through questions and explanations. As soon as he writes it down, he will file the claim due to consistency (show no weakness). Deadlines are often made up to push us to a deal. The phony trick: when wanting to buy something, let people you know make very low offers and then make a slightly higher bet. Your low offer will appear high compared to the others. Be wary of the good-guy bad-guy trick. The good guy tries to win your empathy by protecting you from the outrageous claims from the bad guy. If detected, mention it: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen such a good cop bad cop play‚Äù.. Sound reasonable by bringing objective measures in to play. Before making the other aware of the consequences, ask them if they accept the criteria: ‚ÄúDo you find it reasonable to compare prices to be fair?‚Äù. People prefer distributed wins (finding 2x 10 Euros vs 1x 20 Euros), but losing at once. Chunk advantages and perks to make them seem more. Humans have a strong sense of fairness and even reject deals that are beneficial for them. The absolute price limit can be detected by ever decreasing concessions. Framing: Put arguments that correspond to the others view. If your boss wants to hire the best, argue how an assistant would give more time to focus on the core work. If he wants to save money, argue how it would stop the expensive work force from spending time doing paper work and copying. Overcommitment phenomenon: After a big time investment, we are eager for closing a deal. Don‚Äôt consider sunken cost, but always consider if the deal makes sense. Be wary of low balling: negatives are presented very late. On the other hand, you can use it to negotiate a better deal. Ask the other GRADUALLY for documents, information.. It‚Äôs easy to say no in the beginning, so take it slowly. At the end of a long negotiation, you can ask for an upgrade, as if it were self evident. ‚Äúthe gas tank will be filled right?‚Äù after trying 10 different suits, ask ‚Äúwhich tie is included?‚Äù ","date":"2021-10-01","objectID":"/books/deal/:4:6","tags":null,"title":"Deal!: Du gibst mir, was ich will - Jack Nasher","uri":"/books/deal/"},{"categories":["Book-notes"],"content":"The first offer and haggling Be the first to make an offer for anchoring, unless you don‚Äôt know anything.

When they suggest it, you have still room to negotiate further.. I need to discuss it.. Now we are so close, how about meeting in the middle and close it..

This way you make the other think what he has to offer, before he makes a claim. If you make a high claim and then easily make concessions, you give the impression that you were trying to rip off. The positive effect of concessions diminishes quickly, so ask for something in return immediately. Agree on various unimportant points, to ask for something that is important to you. When the other reveals a limitation / restriction, pretend that you are disappointed and ask for something in return: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs like that, then we get a free breakfast at least?‚Äù When asking for a favor, have something in return to offer: When you stop throwing condoms in my garden, then you can always ring at my door when you need help or a warm coffee.

Moreover, shortcuts can help you save time: Use the CLI as much as possible to get the boilerplate for the yaml files. kubectl run / create are your friends! Configure your bashsrc: vim ~/.bashsrc // add: alias k=kubectl alias kaf='k apply -f' alias kcn='kubectl config set-context --current --namespace' export d=\"--dry-run=client -o yaml\" source \u003c(kubectl completion bash) complete -F __start_kubectl k `` This shortens the syntax and adds bash completion.

Who says that life would have been easier if he were more sexually active? But how often is the reverse true? Unwanted pregnancy.. To maintain self-control over lust, it is helpful to analyze how primitive and mundane our desires are: Sex is no more than friction with ejaculatory discharge.. Our natural impulses to have sex, to desire, feel insulted by other people‚Äôs opinion are driven by evolution, not to have a tranquil life. But we can use our reasoning to resist and pursue tranquility instead. Don‚Äôt take insults personally. Showing indifference is most effective. If they are foolish, deflect the insult with humor. If you don‚Äôt know how to respond, ignore it and keep silent. Don‚Äôt take other people‚Äôs praise nor disapproval. Seeking social status means externalizing our luck, which is out of our control. When a friend feels grieve, grieving with him is like drinking poison after he was poisoned. The goal is to make him feel better, not to make us feel miserable as well. And we are likely to be much more helpful if we don‚Äôt let our feelings be disturbed. Modern philosophy suggests forcing grieve and talking to friends and a psychologist as a mean of processing it. Stoicism tries to make us feel better through reflection and reasoning. Would that person want me to be sad?

Organization and structure are crucial for this system to work, even more than content collection. I can tell from past experience of dead archives that I had long forgotten about their existence. But even worse, file corpses can make it harder to find what we want. In order to overcome this problem, I experimented with a file structure system called PARA, invented by Tiago Forte. ","date":"2021-06-12","objectID":"/posts/para/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Smart file organization - How PARA works for me after 8 months","uri":"/posts/para/"},{"categories":["Second-Brain"],"content":"What is PARA The approach is inspired by the GTD methodology and its central idea is to organize files dynamically into one of 4 categories - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Dynamic means, that current projects are stored in a quickly accessible Project folder and are archived once finished. This sounds trivial, but most people organize files like in a library. A job application draft is hence likely to end up in a file hierarchy like User/Uni/Applications/Interns/Company/.... But given that moving files on a computer is not as tedious, as moving books in a library and that projects have personal context, the dynamic approach in GTD has some benefits. The application document is not just a file with information (like the book), but it is a project that has a deadline and needs many sub-actions (research position and company, write motivation letter, update CV‚Ä¶). It is hence handy to have a central overview of all projects and respective material in a dedicated folder. And in that project folder I only want all the files that are relevant, and not have it mixed among other old applications and unrelated reference material. The latter might still be useful, but it probably just obscures your path to the important documents for the project. This is why PARA distinguishes between actionable items (Projects) and reference material (Resources) at the highest folder level. If you want to read more about the benefits of PARA, I recommend the blog posts from the creator. In the following, I want to share what worked for me after about 8 months of usage. Many people struggle to distinguish the categories and are unsure where to place their files. This also happened to me and I hope that this post can help to clarify it a bit. The author recommends using the system cross-platform for consistency, but I must admit that the structure only made sense to me in the cloud drive and my Notion planner. Not all categories persisted, but those that did, proved valuable.

I try to group the material into topics, but they are generally more fine-grained than life areas. But it still happens that there also exists a folder such as Finance and this is where many people (including me) get confused in the beginning. Should I place my file into Areas or Resources? Or even more important, where did I put it? For me, I distinguish them according to importance. My Areas include important file that I really need (mostly because they are official documents). My resources include reference material, which wouldn‚Äôt be a catastrophe if I‚Äôd somehow lose it. In this sense it is really just an add-on for me which allows me to access non-essential files later, without cluttering up my other directories.

It‚Äôs most well known among programmers for its powerful features to navigate and edit code. VIM users belief that it‚Äôs much smoother to just use the keyboard instead of navigating with a mouse. But besides speed, it is also more ergonomic to rely on the keyboard (you probably heard of the mouse arm, or at least german folks say so)! At the same time it‚Äôs maybe also the most frustrating text editor for first time users - yes, the most frequent google searches are ‚ÄúHow to edit / exit vim?‚Äù. Being said that the learning curve is rather steep, the reward is deferred until you perform your first edit magic with a few keystrokes! Short disclaimer, I will not show you the basics (which the linked resources below do much better than I could), but I will show you some examples that demonstrate its power and elegance. The only thing you need to know is that VIM has a normal mode and an insert mode. The insert mode is for adding content and the normal mode is for editing and navigating code - what we actually spend most time on. Therefore, it‚Äôs also the default mode when you open VIM. This is where newbies get confused when they type and apparently nothing happens üò§‚å®Ô∏è . What is not clear is that their input are VIM commands which most likely do nothing in an empty document.

Let‚Äôs say, you want to change the values of an array to increasing numbers (1, 2, 3‚Ä¶ 10) - without for loops. The classical approach would probably be typing the first statement my_array[0] = 1;, copying the line with the mouse, pasting it a couple of times, and then clicking on each index and value to change it ‚Äî Puuh, this will take you around a minute I guess. In VIM, you only type the first line. Then you type yy10Pww^v10jg^a (^ - Ctrl-key). This looks like madness written out, but trust me - there is logic behind this ü§ì You don‚Äôt need to follow this right now, but in case you are curious: yy copies the entire line, 10P pastes the line ten times above the cursor, ww jumps the cursor two words ahead, ^v goes into block-wise visual mode (similar to how you select with the mouse), 10j selects the next 10 lines g^a increases the selection as desired. These few strokes then result in this: my_array[1] = 1; my_array[2] = 1; my_array[3] = 1; my_array[4] = 1; my_array[5] = 1; my_array[6] = 1; my_array[7] = 1; my_array[8] = 1; my_array[9] = 1; my_array[10] = 1; my_array[11] = 1; , and with very few more keystrokes, we can also increase all the 1s without ever touching the mouse. This of course, also works for similar scenarios where you want to increment all selected numbers by a desired step size, decrement etc. It‚Äôs probably not a situation you need to deal with daily, but I think it serves to show that you can also do sophisticated actions with VIM.

Growing up in a bull market vs depression. Compound effects are extreme and are the key factor for Warren buffets success. The key is to maintain assets for them to grow over time. It‚Äôs the tails who make the big gains. Consistently invest also during bear market. The reasonable wins over the rational strategy because you are more likely to persist with the former. Theoretically best to invest with 50 debt ratio in early years, including bear market, but take the option you sleep well with. It‚Äôs a fallacy to believe that we remain the person we are right now. Therefore, it‚Äôs good to save without knowing for what. Don‚Äôt worry about sunk cost, it‚Äôs about the future and not past efforts. Don‚Äôt go for extremes and bet on a bright future. The price of a stock depends on your time horizon. Do you want to sell in a year, in a decade? Humans are risk averse. Therefore, pessimistic news gain more attention. Whereas huge successes such as a big company growth in a few months may go unnoticed We warp reality around our beliefs / wishes. If we believe that a recession is about to come, we take every sign as a confirmation, although there might be nothing behind it.. We are less critical in that situation. Risk is what is left when you think you have thought of everything. We don‚Äôt tend to accept the complexity of the world, but rather make the world fit our narrative. We need to come to terms with how much is out of our control Define the rules by which you play and make sure you don‚Äôt follow others who have different rules / goals. Bubble speculators‚Ä¶ Independence is the highest goal. It‚Äôs about keeping expectations low to save enough. Make decisions you feel good with. It is not rational to pay a house when interest rates are low, but it gives you the feeling of liberty. Same for cash.

Ingredients for Habit formation: Cue (Make it Obvious vs Invisible): put cues to remind you of doing it. Create an environment with positive cues: Put healthy food at the front. Put book on my pillow. Put yoga mattress on the floor. Craving (Make it Attractive vs Unattractive): anything unattractive costs willpower which is limited. Routine (Make it Easy vs Difficult): Make a new habit take up less than 2 minutes. Make it a ritual and not look like a chore. Stop before it feels like work. Increase friction for negative habits. Habit formation is about frequency, not time. Create a routine while doing something positive and enjoyable. After a while the routine becomes associated with this mood, so you can induce it by doing the routine. E.g.: Put on headphones (=focus time) to study Reward (Make it Satisfying vs Unsatisfying): behaviors that are immediately rewarded get repeated, those that are punished don‚Äôt. The reward comes from the anticipation of the action, not the action itself. ‚Üí Use, existing pleasant habits and add to them a new wanted habit.

After all, we spend a considerable amount of time doing it. It might be to research something specific, to learn something new, or simply to entertain ourselves. The internet provides a rich resource of information, but it‚Äôs probably also the most distracting source. We might start the browser to check some specific information, but as we go, we find another article on the side that catches our attention. It sounds too interesting to dismiss! The article might link to an exciting video on youtube. Of course, we want to see it, and it only takes 2 minutes after all! But once you are on youtube, you probably all know how easy it is to get in an open-loop. Our initial search to look up information on having a pet might eventually end with kitten videos on youtube (and they can go even much further..). Yes, they are cute, but is it helpful to decide at this moment? I know this example is very contrived and ridiculous, but surely most of us regularly get into these open loops. And for me, this situation was also tricky. On the one hand, I didn‚Äôt want to dismiss interesting articles, but I also felt conscience-stricken about getting distracted by content that is not relevant at this moment. Of course, there are easy ways around this. Some use bookmarks, and others like to keep 50+ tabs open in their browser (I was astounded when I saw this!). But I believe that save-for-later apps provide several benefits over classical bookmarks (and the tabs option, of course).

In fact, platforms are designed to take us into this open-loop trap of consumption. That‚Äôs good for their success, but do you want this? Having a dedicated place to store and the mindset of content collection helped me escape the open-loops more often. Also, I didn‚Äôt particularly like cluttering my bookmarks, intended for quickly accessing frequently visited websites, with specific content I want to checkout (this list can grow quickly..). Now, I can read whenever I want to and also don‚Äôt miss out on good content. Easily find what you want I like to save my content in categories. The Check-Later app lets me choose a topic and get access to all the related resources. What makes this better than bookmarks is that you have a keyword search that checks all your articles' content - very neat! Also, I can archive articles after having read them and still access them later through search. More selective content choices Whenever I see something that catches my attention now, I think twice if I really want to consume this. For once, it takes slightly more effort than just clicking on the link (so lazy, I know). Secondly, I know that it will have to compete with all the other appealing stuff on my list. Knowledge conservation Besides the benefit of quickly retrieving old content, it also provides the ability to store highlights of articles and attach notes. It is then possible to extract your highlights and notes and review them. I‚Äôm forgetful of details, and statistics show that the majority does, so I like to be reminded of interesting ideas. Also, I like how these old ideas connect with others and expand. It makes me feel more convinced that what I‚Äôm reading now is not just for the moment but part of something bigger that grows over time. Reading experience In a read-later app, every article is displayed plainly as text, like a book, without all the distractions on websites. Also, when used on a mobile app, you can access them offline. With Instapaper you have a good overview of your content and quickly find old articles and notes through search.

Unfortunately, the free version is limited to five notes per month and doesn‚Äôt support a full-text search for all articles. But the free version is good to try it out and enough for light usage. For developers, it also provides an Open API (I might try this in the future). Compared to its close competitor, Pocket, its premium version is also significantly cheaper ($29.99/year ~‚Ç¨23). Pocket Its basic principle is very similar to Instapaper but provides slightly more functionality (tags, text to speech..). The free version is limited to 3 highlights per article (which I find very restrictive) and doesn‚Äôt include a full-text search. Its premium version is ‚Ç¨39.99/year. Raindrop.io It‚Äôs the closest option to the classical bookmark manager but is much more attractive and powerful. You can organize links in folders, attach tags, and it has a beautiful interface. The premium version also provides full-text search and full download of the websites, but it also has good free functionality. Be aware, however, that it doesn‚Äôt support text highlighting nor note-taking. Readwise This app is different and intended as an extension of a check-later app. It builds on the idea of knowledge conservation and lets you revisit your ebook \u0026 article highlights. According to your preferences, it provides five selected highlights per day as part of spaced repetition. Simply put, it is the Anki version for what you read. You can also include gaps in the highlight or reformulate it as a question to trigger your memory. The premium version even supports export to Evernote \u0026 Notion. You can connect it to a wide variety of services such as Instapaper and Pocket, but it also supports Twitter, Kindle, PDF import, Airr (currently iOS only, but great for highlighting in Podcasts), and many more. This app is, however, not free and distinguishes between a Lite version ($4.49 billed annually or $4.99 billed monthly) and the full version ($7.99 billed annually or $8.99 billed monthly). Students also enjoy a 50% discount. I agree that this is quite some money for the basic functionality to review your highlights, and I still have to figure out if it‚Äôs worth the price for me. However, it provides a free month trial for everyone, and the invitation system puts an extra free month on top. So I think it‚Äôs worth giving it a shot. If you want to try it out, you are welcome to use my referral link, which grants both of us an extra free month. It would also be interesting for me to hear your opinion on it! It could also be interesting to develop such a service (for import in Anki maybe?). The Instapaper API and an article on how to export Kindle highlights inspired me to maybe try it out in the future.

Collaboration feature Yes, working collaboratively on documents is no different from Google Docs, but it is still nice to organize projects and ideas in the lean Notion style. Databases One feature I started to appreciate a lot after some time is databases. When you create a new page, you can decide between a table, kanban board, calendar, etc. But they are all essentially databases which just differ in their visualization. So if you later find that your initial table might be much better represented as a nice gallery, that is possible with a click. What I especially appreciate about them is their relations. I like how information is connected in this way without cluttering it up. This makes it possible to link your meeting notes separate from the project or link your book list to the person who recommended it.

I had been using a calendar and to-do-list before, but Tiago Forte‚Äôs Weekly Review and ideas from David Allen‚Äôs GTD¬†brought my organization to another level. They help me to get my priorities straight and truncate my work into actionable items. I will cover the techniques in later posts, so stay tuned!

By storing thoughts and relevant information in a central place, you no longer need to worry about them. Who doesn‚Äôt know it? It‚Äôs so easy to get distracted during work, because different ideas and responsibilities pop up. Stopping this completely might seem unfeasible, but every written down item is one less to worry about. This mental offloading of information also helps to calm my mind and be more present. I find this not only beneficial for focused working but also to be happier. And of course, people around you highly appreciate the presence of mind! It goes without saying that changing this behavior takes time and effort, but I think it is worthwhile to strive for.

First, I was unhappy with how much I forget about the content I consume: be it books, articles, videos. As an enthusiastic language learner, I‚Äôm highly convinced of spaced-repetition, so I thought that I could also more generally apply this technique. The first step for me was to make the content retrievable. From past experience, I found general notetaking on specific content not sustainable for long-term storage (I tended to never look it up again). Moreover, I wanted to build up a reference system for interesting source to check later. Not everything we consume or find is relevant at the moment, but it would be valuable to be able to pick up the content once it is needed. At the same time, the system needs to be powerful enough to actually find the information you need; storing is not enough ;) For this, I found the PARA file hierarchy very helpful. Moreover, I extended my workflow with tools for processing all kinds of information: be it academic, documents, media content, thoughts. I also changed my way of how and what I consume.

I realized how good writing is to process my thoughts. I don‚Äôt fancy writing poetic texts, but I find it highly practical to communicate ideas concisely. As I started to take notes, I also noticed how it precipitated an avalanche of new thoughts and ideas. On a podcast episode, I also found that other people seem to experience the same. Maybe you find this neat too? Finally, I became more self-reflective not only about my planning but also on how I do things. Again, I don‚Äôt want to go into details, but you will find posts about this later if you are interested.

There are simply too many self-proclaimed productivity and self-improvement books, who promise to change your life (and I assertively object such claims!). Many ideas sound nice but remain abstract, don‚Äôt get applied and are consequently forgotten. I think that Derek Sivers put it very nicely: You may hear something or see something that gives you a new idea. But it‚Äôs only when you stop and think of your work through this new perspective, that you actually jump up and go turn the idea into reality. That‚Äôs the real inspiration that everyone is looking for. ‚Äì Derek Sivers In the upcoming posts, I want to give some practical insights on how I applied these techniques to my life.

Who doesn‚Äôt know it, after having an initial spark on how to solve a problem, it is tentative to immediately start coding. I guess most of us did so initially and almost always ended up on dead-end roads. Taking the time to think a design through before writing the first line is indispensable for larger projects but even makes things easier for smaller undertakings. Object-oriented programming is a very common and powerful paradigm to write code. The patterns I refer to are based on this principle and give guidelines on how to design classes and interfaces. The main motivation for these patterns is code reusability and easier maintenance. Code shouldn‚Äôt break after adjusting a single line. Also, extending the functionality shouldn‚Äôt need a big refactor.

It‚Äôs a universal toolkit: They are motivated by general principles and allow you to think and frame problems in new ways. They help to see the bigger picture by abstracting the problem specifics. Understand other code more easily: The recognition of patterns can help read other code. Patterns encipher intent, so it might reveal why code was designed that way.

Moreover, the book has a clear structure for each design. It starts with a problem that the pattern addresses. The pattern structure is explained (with UML diagram), and pseudo-code is given. Moreover, the book comes with source code for solutions in several common languages (Python, C++, Go, Java, Swift‚Ä¶). It not only mentions when to use it but also when to not use it. Finally, the relationship with other patterns is laid out. This is useful to distinguish patterns with a similar structure, but it also mentions how they might be combined.

Each day, I read about two to three patterns. I then went through a source-code implementation to understand the language‚Äôs specifics and make the constructs more relatable. I focused on Python but always glimpsed at the Go solution to learn about its language specialties. Also, the author of the Go solutions was a bit more creative with the hypothetical problems :) After that, I thought about a problem by myself and how I could apply the pattern. I then implemented a sketchy solution in Python. This was definitely the most time-intensive part, but I believe that it is crucial for learning.
