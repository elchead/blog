[{"categories":["Second-Brain"],"content":"More than half a year ago, I started building my second brain - an intent to store information digitally to offload it from your brain. Organization and structure are crucial for this system to work, even more than content collection. I can tell from past experience of dead archives that I had long forgotten about their existence. But even worse, file corpses can make it harder to find what we want. In order to overcome this problem, I experimented with a file structure system called PARA, invented by Tiago Forte. ","date":"2021-06-12","objectID":"/posts/para/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Smart file organization - How PARA works for me after 8 months","uri":"/posts/para/"},{"categories":["Second-Brain"],"content":"What is PARA The approach is inspired by the GTD methodology and its central idea is to organize files dynamically into one of 4 categories - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Dynamic means, that current projects are stored in a quickly accessible Project folder and are archived once finished. This sounds trivial, but most people organize files like in a library. A job application draft is hence likely to end up in a file hierarchy like User/Uni/Applications/Interns/Company/.... But given that moving files on a computer is not as tedious, as moving books in a library and that projects have personal context, the dynamic approach in GTD has some benefits. The application document is not just a file with information (like the book), but it is a project that has a deadline and needs many sub-actions (research position and company, write motivation letter, update CV‚Ä¶). It is hence handy to have a central overview of all projects and respective material in a dedicated folder. And in that project folder I only want all the files that are relevant, and not have it mixed among other old applications and unrelated reference material. The latter might still be useful, but it probably just obscures your path to the important documents for the project. This is why PARA distinguishes between actionable items (Projects) and reference material (Resources) at the highest folder level. If you want to read more about the benefits of PARA, I recommend the blog posts from the creator. In the following, I want to share what worked for me after about 8 months of usage. Many people struggle to distinguish the categories and are unsure where to place their files. This also happened to me and I hope that this post can help to clarify it a bit. The author recommends using the system cross-platform for consistency, but I must admit that the structure only made sense to me in the cloud drive and my Notion planner. Not all categories persisted, but those that did, proved valuable.

Also, I find it faster to store small things on my desktop and download folder, which I clean up during my weekly review.

Resources: Resources is intended as a place to store information that I don‚Äôt need now. I use it to store PDFs and presentations that I might want to refer to later. This can be travel inspirations, a programming book or a presentation I liked a lot and might want to share later. I try to group the material into topics, but they are generally more fine-grained than life areas. But it still happens that there also exists a folder such as Finance and this is where many people (including me) get confused in the beginning. Should I place my file into Areas or Resources? Or even more important, where did I put it? For me, I distinguish them according to importance. My Areas include important file that I really need (mostly because they are official documents). My resources include reference material, which wouldn‚Äôt be a catastrophe if I‚Äôd somehow lose it. In this sense it is really just an add-on for me which allows me to access non-essential files later, without cluttering up my other directories. Because it is not essential, I realized that I also tend to forget about what is inside, which makes it a bit futile right? I believe that the best way to make good use of the resources is to review and potentially clean them monthly. But as always, only keep what serves you.

It‚Äôs most well known among programmers for its powerful features to navigate and edit code. VIM users belief that it‚Äôs much smoother to just use the keyboard instead of navigating with a mouse. But besides speed, it is also more ergonomic to rely on the keyboard (you probably heard of the mouse arm, or at least german folks say so)! At the same time it‚Äôs maybe also the most frustrating text editor for first time users - yes, the most frequent google searches are ‚ÄúHow to edit / exit vim?‚Äù. Being said that the learning curve is rather steep, the reward is deferred until you perform your first edit magic with a few keystrokes! Short disclaimer, I will not show you the basics (which the linked resources below do much better than I could), but I will show you some examples that demonstrate its power and elegance. The only thing you need to know is that VIM has a normal mode and an insert mode. The insert mode is for adding content and the normal mode is for editing and navigating code - what we actually spend most time on. Therefore, it‚Äôs also the default mode when you open VIM. This is where newbies get confused when they type and apparently nothing happens üò§‚å®Ô∏è . What is not clear is that their input are VIM commands which most likely do nothing in an empty document. With this in mind, we can now dive into the examples.

Better than fiddling with the mouse, isn‚Äôt it? Ok, that was simple. How about something super related to Javascript, C++ programmers - the missing braces.

Let‚Äôs say, you want to change the values of an array to increasing numbers (1, 2, 3‚Ä¶ 10) - without for loops. The classical approach would probably be typing the first statement my_array[0] = 1;, copying the line with the mouse, pasting it a couple of times, and then clicking on each index and value to change it ‚Äî Puuh, this will take you around a minute I guess. In VIM, you only type the first line. Then you type yy10Pww^v10jg^a (^ - Ctrl-key). This looks like madness written out, but trust me - there is logic behind this ü§ì You don‚Äôt need to follow this right now, but in case you are curious: yy copies the entire line, 10P pastes the line ten times above the cursor, ww jumps the cursor two words ahead, ^v goes into block-wise visual mode (similar to how you select with the mouse), 10j selects the next 10 lines g^a increases the selection as desired. These few strokes then result in this: my_array[1] = 1; my_array[2] = 1; my_array[3] = 1; my_array[4] = 1; my_array[5] = 1; my_array[6] = 1; my_array[7] = 1; my_array[8] = 1; my_array[9] = 1; my_array[10] = 1; my_array[11] = 1; , and with very few more keystrokes, we can also increase all the 1s without ever touching the mouse. This of course, also works for similar scenarios where you want to increment all selected numbers by a desired step size, decrement etc. It‚Äôs probably not a situation you need to deal with daily, but I think it serves to show that you can also do sophisticated actions with VIM. And it‚Äôs very configurable. Most VIMers adjust the profiles to what is useful to them and share their config on the internet.

It‚Äôs the fee you pay to get access to high returns. Not a fine for taking risks. Bet on the success of the few. Failures don‚Äôt matter if they finally somehow lead to success. Taking risks makes success more likely and failures are normal. But never risk failures that could destroy you completely. Also invest during bear market (time is your best friend ). Keep your expectations low. Wealth is not just about income but also about our spending behavior.

Growing up in a bull market vs depression. Compound effects are extreme and are the key factor for Warren buffets success. The key is to maintain assets for them to grow over time. It‚Äôs the tails who make the big gains. Consistently invest also during bear market. The reasonable wins over the rational strategy because you are more likely to persist with the former. Theoretically best to invest with 50 debt ratio in early years, including bear market, but take the option you sleep well with. It‚Äôs a fallacy to believe that we remain the person we are right now. Therefore, it‚Äôs good to save without knowing for what. Don‚Äôt worry about sunk cost, it‚Äôs about the future and not past efforts. Don‚Äôt go for extremes and bet on a bright future. The price of a stock depends on your time horizon. Do you want to sell in a year, in a decade? Humans are risk averse. Therefore, pessimistic news gain more attention. Whereas huge successes such as a big company growth in a few months may go unnoticed We warp reality around our beliefs / wishes. If we believe that a recession is about to come, we take every sign as a confirmation, although there might be nothing behind it.. We are less critical in that situation. Risk is what is left when you think you have thought of everything. We don‚Äôt tend to accept the complexity of the world, but rather make the world fit our narrative. We need to come to terms with how much is out of our control Define the rules by which you play and make sure you don‚Äôt follow others who have different rules / goals. Bubble speculators‚Ä¶ Independence is the highest goal. It‚Äôs about keeping expectations low to save enough. Make decisions you feel good with. It is not rational to pay a house when interest rates are low, but it gives you the feeling of liberty. Same for cash.

After all, we spend a considerable amount of time doing it. It might be to research something specific, to learn something new, or simply to entertain ourselves. The internet provides a rich resource of information, but it‚Äôs probably also the most distracting source. We might start the browser to check some specific information, but as we go, we find another article on the side that catches our attention. It sounds too interesting to dismiss! The article might link to an exciting video on youtube. Of course, we want to see it, and it only takes 2 minutes after all! But once you are on youtube, you probably all know how easy it is to get in an open-loop. Our initial search to look up information on having a pet might eventually end with kitten videos on youtube (and they can go even much further..). Yes, they are cute, but is it helpful to decide at this moment? I know this example is very contrived and ridiculous, but surely most of us regularly get into these open loops. And for me, this situation was also tricky. On the one hand, I didn‚Äôt want to dismiss interesting articles, but I also felt conscience-stricken about getting distracted by content that is not relevant at this moment. Of course, there are easy ways around this. Some use bookmarks, and others like to keep 50+ tabs open in their browser (I was astounded when I saw this!). But I believe that save-for-later apps provide several benefits over classical bookmarks (and the tabs option, of course).

In fact, platforms are designed to take us into this open-loop trap of consumption. That‚Äôs good for their success, but do you want this? Having a dedicated place to store and the mindset of content collection helped me escape the open-loops more often. Also, I didn‚Äôt particularly like cluttering my bookmarks, intended for quickly accessing frequently visited websites, with specific content I want to checkout (this list can grow quickly..). Now, I can read whenever I want to and also don‚Äôt miss out on good content. Easily find what you want I like to save my content in categories. The Check-Later app lets me choose a topic and get access to all the related resources. What makes this better than bookmarks is that you have a keyword search that checks all your articles' content - very neat! Also, I can archive articles after having read them and still access them later through search. More selective content choices Whenever I see something that catches my attention now, I think twice if I really want to consume this. For once, it takes slightly more effort than just clicking on the link (so lazy, I know). Secondly, I know that it will have to compete with all the other appealing stuff on my list. Knowledge conservation Besides the benefit of quickly retrieving old content, it also provides the ability to store highlights of articles and attach notes. It is then possible to extract your highlights and notes and review them. I‚Äôm forgetful of details, and statistics show that the majority does, so I like to be reminded of interesting ideas. Also, I like how these old ideas connect with others and expand. It makes me feel more convinced that what I‚Äôm reading now is not just for the moment but part of something bigger that grows over time. Reading experience In a read-later app, every article is displayed plainly as text, like a book, without all the distractions on websites. Also, when used on a mobile app, you can access them offline. With Instapaper you have a good overview of your content and quickly find old articles and notes through search.

Unfortunately, the free version is limited to five notes per month and doesn‚Äôt support a full-text search for all articles. But the free version is good to try it out and enough for light usage. For developers, it also provides an Open API (I might try this in the future). Compared to its close competitor, Pocket, its premium version is also significantly cheaper ($29.99/year ~‚Ç¨23). Pocket Its basic principle is very similar to Instapaper but provides slightly more functionality (tags, text to speech..). The free version is limited to 3 highlights per article (which I find very restrictive) and doesn‚Äôt include a full-text search. Its premium version is ‚Ç¨39.99/year. Raindrop.io It‚Äôs the closest option to the classical bookmark manager but is much more attractive and powerful. You can organize links in folders, attach tags, and it has a beautiful interface. The premium version also provides full-text search and full download of the websites, but it also has good free functionality. Be aware, however, that it doesn‚Äôt support text highlighting nor note-taking. Readwise This app is different and intended as an extension of a check-later app. It builds on the idea of knowledge conservation and lets you revisit your ebook \u0026 article highlights. According to your preferences, it provides five selected highlights per day as part of spaced repetition. Simply put, it is the Anki version for what you read. You can also include gaps in the highlight or reformulate it as a question to trigger your memory. The premium version even supports export to Evernote \u0026 Notion. You can connect it to a wide variety of services such as Instapaper and Pocket, but it also supports Twitter, Kindle, PDF import, Airr (currently iOS only, but great for highlighting in Podcasts), and many more. This app is, however, not free and distinguishes between a Lite version ($4.49 billed annually or $4.99 billed monthly) and the full version ($7.99 billed annually or $8.99 billed monthly). Students also enjoy a 50% discount. I agree that this is quite some money for the basic functionality to review your highlights, and I still have to figure out if it‚Äôs worth the price for me. However, it provides a free month trial for everyone, and the invitation system puts an extra free month on top. So I think it‚Äôs worth giving it a shot. If you want to try it out, you are welcome to use my referral link, which grants both of us an extra free month. It would also be interesting for me to hear your opinion on it! It could also be interesting to develop such a service (for import in Anki maybe?). The Instapaper API and an article on how to export Kindle highlights inspired me to maybe try it out in the future.

For personal use, you practically don‚Äôt have to pay to enjoy the full Notion experience. Unlike other apps, the premium option unlocks perks but no crucial features.

Collaboration feature Yes, working collaboratively on documents is no different from Google Docs, but it is still nice to organize projects and ideas in the lean Notion style. Databases One feature I started to appreciate a lot after some time is databases. When you create a new page, you can decide between a table, kanban board, calendar, etc. But they are all essentially databases which just differ in their visualization. So if you later find that your initial table might be much better represented as a nice gallery, that is possible with a click. What I especially appreciate about them is their relations. I like how information is connected in this way without cluttering it up. This makes it possible to link your meeting notes separate from the project or link your book list to the person who recommended it. Markdown+ I like Markdown‚Äôs focus on content with minimalistic styling elements.

I struggled quite a bit on finding a proper word because it touches so many aspects. It is related to productivity, self-improvement, and knowledge management. In the end, I think that the term second brain, made famous by Tiago Forte, is maybe a good superordinate for what it tries to achieve. In fact, I was hugely inspired by him and adopted a lot of his ideas. He describes the second-brain as a knowledge management system.

It is also helpful for those who would like to bring a bit more structure in their self-organization. I fully acknowledge that it might not fit everyone, but if you are a bit excited by now, I think that you might find something useful. This post might feel a bit overwhelming by trying to give an encompassing vision, but I will split up the upcoming posts thematically. When I started, I really just wanted to find a system to organize myself better. But I quickly started enjoying the process of tweaking my workflow and learning more about it. While it also helped me become more productive, the most meaningful benefit for me is what I found (and still find) out about myself during the journey. If you are still with me, let‚Äôs get started.

We haven‚Äôt got enough time! There are simply too many things we would like to do. As a consequence, we tend to overload ourselves trying to keep up with our thirsty curiosity. Life is a rush; while doing one thing, we are already thinking about what is upcoming. At some point, we might feel overwhelmed and stressed out. We hassle each day, and at the end of the day, we still might feel frustrated about not having achieved everything we aimed for. Then I realized that time-management is solely about priorities. Time is limited, and it is more helpful to accept that than somehow trying to stretch it (which won‚Äôt work üòâ). Secondly, I gained another perspective on being busy. Being busy means I‚Äôm out of control ‚Äì Derek Sivers When I constantly feel busy, it is probably time to reexamine my system and rules. That is not to say that I want to be lazier, but that I want to be more focused and thoughtful about my actions. As part of this system, I want to become more aware of my time management.

We all know it from very vividly from New Year‚Äôs resolutions: it‚Äôs easy to make plans but it‚Äôs hard to execute them. Often, we either don‚Äôt find the time or feel paralyzed about how to get started. In this problems pursuit, I adopted some habits to help me get my prioritized work done. I had been using a calendar and to-do-list before, but Tiago Forte‚Äôs Weekly Review and ideas from David Allen‚Äôs GTD¬†brought my organization to another level. They help me to get my priorities straight and truncate my work into actionable items. I will cover the techniques in later posts, so stay tuned!

By storing thoughts and relevant information in a central place, you no longer need to worry about them. Who doesn‚Äôt know it? It‚Äôs so easy to get distracted during work, because different ideas and responsibilities pop up. Stopping this completely might seem unfeasible, but every written down item is one less to worry about. This mental offloading of information also helps to calm my mind and be more present. I find this not only beneficial for focused working but also to be happier. And of course, people around you highly appreciate the presence of mind! It goes without saying that changing this behavior takes time and effort, but I think it is worthwhile to strive for.

First, I was unhappy with how much I forget about the content I consume: be it books, articles, videos. As an enthusiastic language learner, I‚Äôm highly convinced of spaced-repetition, so I thought that I could also more generally apply this technique. The first step for me was to make the content retrievable. From past experience, I found general notetaking on specific content not sustainable for long-term storage (I tended to never look it up again). Moreover, I wanted to build up a reference system for interesting source to check later. Not everything we consume or find is relevant at the moment, but it would be valuable to be able to pick up the content once it is needed. At the same time, the system needs to be powerful enough to actually find the information you need; storing is not enough ;) For this, I found the PARA file hierarchy very helpful. Moreover, I extended my workflow with tools for processing all kinds of information: be it academic, documents, media content, thoughts. I also changed my way of how and what I consume.

I realized how good writing is to process my thoughts. I don‚Äôt fancy writing poetic texts, but I find it highly practical to communicate ideas concisely. As I started to take notes, I also noticed how it precipitated an avalanche of new thoughts and ideas. On a podcast episode, I also found that other people seem to experience the same. Maybe you find this neat too? Finally, I became more self-reflective not only about my planning but also on how I do things.

There are simply too many self-proclaimed productivity and self-improvement books, who promise to change your life (and I assertively object such claims!). Many ideas sound nice but remain abstract, don‚Äôt get applied and are consequently forgotten. I think that Derek Sivers put it very nicely: You may hear something or see something that gives you a new idea. But it‚Äôs only when you stop and think of your work through this new perspective, that you actually jump up and go turn the idea into reality. That‚Äôs the real inspiration that everyone is looking for. ‚Äì Derek Sivers In the upcoming posts, I want to give some practical insights on how I applied these techniques to my life.

Who doesn‚Äôt know it, after having an initial spark on how to solve a problem, it is tentative to immediately start coding. I guess most of us did so initially and almost always ended up on dead-end roads. Taking the time to think a design through before writing the first line is indispensable for larger projects but even makes things easier for smaller undertakings. Object-oriented programming is a very common and powerful paradigm to write code. The patterns I refer to are based on this principle and give guidelines on how to design classes and interfaces. The main motivation for these patterns is code reusability and easier maintenance. Code shouldn‚Äôt break after adjusting a single line. Also, extending the functionality shouldn‚Äôt need a big refactor.

Don‚Äôt try to reinvent the wheel: Design patterns are tested and tried solutions, so they are probably useful for you too. It‚Äôs a universal toolkit: They are motivated by general principles and allow you to think and frame problems in new ways. They help to see the bigger picture by abstracting the problem specifics. Understand other code more easily: The recognition of patterns can help read other code. Patterns encipher intent, so it might reveal why code was designed that way.

It doesn‚Äôt remain abstract but instead tries to relate it to practice. I found the real-world analogies to the patterns sometimes quite amusing. Moreover, the book has a clear structure for each design. It starts with a problem that the pattern addresses. The pattern structure is explained (with UML diagram), and pseudo-code is given. Moreover, the book comes with source code for solutions in several common languages (Python, C++, Go, Java, Swift‚Ä¶). It not only mentions when to use it but also when to not use it. Finally, the relationship with other patterns is laid out. This is useful to distinguish patterns with a similar structure, but it also mentions how they might be combined.

Each day, I read about two to three patterns. I then went through a source-code implementation to understand the language‚Äôs specifics and make the constructs more relatable. I focused on Python but always glimpsed at the Go solution to learn about its language specialties. Also, the author of the Go solutions was a bit more creative with the hypothetical problems :) After that, I thought about a problem by myself and how I could apply the pattern. I then implemented a sketchy solution in Python. This was definitely the most time-intensive part, but I believe that it is crucial for learning.
