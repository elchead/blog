It was the first year where I started to prefer it consistently over listening to music. In the beginning, it was mainly for practicing Chinese (Speak Chinese Naturally, GuShiFM, DaPeng Speak Chinese), and they helped me a lot! I still remember how I occasionally trapped myself evading from them because it was demanding, and the stories were not always very exciting. Now, this has gone away and I even listen to doze off. But it was only until the second half of the year when I found them as a source of inspiration and realized how much I enjoy listening to philosophical and deeply personal conversations. I first shared the episodes of Derek Sivers and Naval Ravikant with my mentor. He was also excited by them and I really like how we now sometimes cite the episodes to explain our ideas or make a point.

After all, we spend a considerable amount of time doing it. It might be to research something specific, to learn something new, or simply to entertain ourselves. The internet provides a rich resource of information, but it’s probably also the most distracting source. We might start the browser to check some specific information, but as we go, we find another article on the side that catches our attention. It sounds too interesting to dismiss! The article might link to an exciting video on youtube. Of course, we want to see it, and it only takes 2 minutes after all! But once you are on youtube, you probably all know how easy it is to get in an open-loop. Our initial search to look up information on having a pet might eventually end with kitten videos on youtube (and they can go even much further..). Yes, they are cute, but is it helpful to decide at this moment? I know this example is very contrived and ridiculous, but surely most of us regularly get into these open loops. And for me, this situation was also tricky. On the one hand, I didn’t want to dismiss interesting articles, but I also felt conscience-stricken about getting distracted by content that is not relevant at this moment. Of course, there are easy ways around this. Some use bookmarks, and others like to keep 50+ tabs open in their browser (I was astounded when I saw this!). But I believe that save-for-later apps provide several benefits over classical bookmarks (and the tabs option, of course).

In fact, platforms are designed to take us into this open-loop trap of consumption. That’s good for their success, but do you want this? Having a dedicated place to store and the mindset of content collection helped me escape the open-loops more often. Also, I didn’t particularly like cluttering my bookmarks, intended for quickly accessing frequently visited websites, with specific content I want to checkout (this list can grow quickly..). Now, I can read whenever I want to and also don’t miss out on good content. Easily find what you want I like to save my content in categories. The Check-Later app lets me choose a topic and get access to all the related resources. What makes this better than bookmarks is that you have a keyword search that checks all your articles' content - very neat! Also, I can archive articles after having read them and still access them later through search. More selective content choices Whenever I see something that catches my attention now, I think twice if I really want to consume this. For once, it takes slightly more effort than just clicking on the link (so lazy, I know). Secondly, I know that it will have to compete with all the other appealing stuff on my list. Knowledge conservation Besides the benefit of quickly retrieving old content, it also provides the ability to store highlights of articles and attach notes. It is then possible to extract your highlights and notes and review them. I’m forgetful of details, and statistics show that the majority does, so I like to be reminded of interesting ideas. Also, I like how these old ideas connect with others and expand. It makes me feel more convinced that what I’m reading now is not just for the moment but part of something bigger that grows over time. Reading experience In a read-later app, every article is displayed plainly as text, like a book, without all the distractions on websites. Also, when used on a mobile app, you can access them offline. With Instapaper you have a good overview of your content and quickly find old articles and notes through search.

Unfortunately, the free version is limited to five notes per month and doesn’t support a full-text search for all articles. But the free version is good to try it out and enough for light usage. For developers, it also provides an Open API (I might try this in the future). Compared to its close competitor, Pocket, its premium version is also significantly cheaper ($29.99/year ~€23). Pocket Its basic principle is very similar to Instapaper but provides slightly more functionality (tags, text to speech..). The free version is limited to 3 highlights per article (which I find very restrictive) and doesn’t include a full-text search. Its premium version is €39.99/year. Raindrop.io It’s the closest option to the classical bookmark manager but is much more attractive and powerful. You can organize links in folders, attach tags, and it has a beautiful interface. The premium version also provides full-text search and full download of the websites, but it also has good free functionality. Be aware, however, that it doesn’t support text highlighting nor note-taking. Readwise This app is different and intended as an extension of a check-later app. It builds on the idea of knowledge conservation and lets you revisit your ebook \u0026 article highlights. According to your preferences, it provides five selected highlights per day as part of spaced repetition. Simply put, it is the Anki version for what you read. You can also include gaps in the highlight or reformulate it as a question to trigger your memory. The premium version even supports export to Evernote \u0026 Notion. You can connect it to a wide variety of services such as Instapaper and Pocket, but it also supports Twitter, Kindle, PDF import, Airr (currently iOS only, but great for highlighting in Podcasts), and many more. This app is, however, not free and distinguishes between a Lite version ($4.49 billed annually or $4.99 billed monthly) and the full version ($7.99 billed annually or $8.99 billed monthly). Students also enjoy a 50% discount. I agree that this is quite some money for the basic functionality to review your highlights, and I still have to figure out if it’s worth the price for me. However, it provides a free month trial for everyone, and the invitation system puts an extra free month on top. So I think it’s worth giving it a shot. If you want to try it out, you are welcome to use my referral link, which grants both of us an extra free month. It would also be interesting for me to hear your opinion on it! It could also be interesting to develop such a service (for import in Anki maybe?). The Instapaper API and an article on how to export Kindle highlights inspired me to maybe try it out in the future.

I always had difficulties keeping notes that I would like to check again, which discouraged me from using them extensively. Notion completely changed my attitude toward note-taking and writing because it made it fun - Yes, it indirectly made me write this blog! I was quite hyped when I first saw how people used it as a life hub to have all information and planning in one place. I’ve heard several people say that Notion has shaped their thinking because of how information is naturally stored in this system. And I couldn’t agree less!

It consists of four categories and distinguishes information according to its actionability instead of topics. This is motivated by the Getting Things Done principle and worth another post. I won’t explain it here, but there are a lot of good resources if you are interested. I find it most useful to keep track of my responsibilities and goals. It helps me see where I am and what I should prioritize right now. For this, I mainly use the first two categories in Notion, but all four are: Projects: Here I place all my current projects, which are not necessarily as big as they commonly sound. It might be a new tool I’d like to try out, a book I want to read, or finding a birthday present. Areas: Here I list all areas which I want or need to keep track of. I like to revisit them regularly as part of my weekly review to check if any of them deserves some more attention or action. For me they include: career, health, my website, Chinese, finance… Resources: It’s pretty empty for me because of other outsourcing tools, but I intend to use it mostly for notes, documents, and articles that are not relevant right now bight might be later.

For personal use, you practically don’t have to pay to enjoy the full Notion experience. Unlike other apps, the premium option unlocks perks but no crucial features. (unlimited file uploads, version history, access to the Content API). And students even get the upgrade for free! Collaboration feature Yes, working collaboratively on documents is no different from Google Docs, but it is still nice to organize projects and ideas in the lean Notion style. Databases One feature I started to appreciate a lot after some time is databases. When you create a new page, you can decide between a table, kanban board, calendar, etc. But they are all essentially databases which just differ in their visualization. So if you later find that your initial table might be much better represented as a nice gallery, that is possible with a click. What I especially appreciate about them is their relations. I like how information is connected in this way without cluttering it up. This makes it possible to link your meeting notes separate from the project or link your book list to the person who recommended it. Markdown+ I like Markdown’s focus on content with minimalistic styling elements. Also, it supports the integration of math equations, code snippets, etc. Additionally, Notion offers a few extra features for styling (e.g., toggle lists and callouts, date referencing…).

I struggled quite a bit on finding a proper word because it touches so many aspects. It is related to productivity, self-improvement, and knowledge management. In the end, I think that the term second brain, made famous by Tiago Forte, is maybe a good superordinate for what it tries to achieve. In fact, I was hugely inspired by him and adopted a lot of his ideas. He describes the second-brain as a knowledge management system.

We hassle each day, and at the end of the day, we still might feel frustrated about not having achieved everything we aimed for. Then I realized that time-management is solely about priorities. Time is limited, and it is more helpful to accept that than somehow trying to stretch it (which won’t work 😉). Secondly, I gained another perspective on being busy.

First, I was unhappy with how much I forget about the content I consume: be it books, articles, videos. As an enthusiastic language learner, I’m highly convinced of spaced-repetition, so I thought that I could also more generally apply this technique. The first step for me was to make the content retrievable. From past experience, I found general notetaking on specific content not sustainable for long-term storage (I tended to never look it up again). Moreover, I wanted to build up a reference system for interesting source to check later. Not everything we consume or find is relevant at the moment, but it would be valuable to be able to pick up the content once it is needed. At the same time, the system needs to be powerful enough to actually find the information you need; storing is not enough ;) For this, I found the PARA file hierarchy very helpful. Moreover, I extended my workflow with tools for processing all kinds of information: be it academic, documents, media content, thoughts. I also changed my way of how and what I consume.

I think that Derek Sivers put it very nicely: You may hear something or see something that gives you a new idea.

Object-oriented programming is a very common and powerful paradigm to write code. The patterns I refer to are based on this principle and give guidelines on how to design classes and interfaces. The main motivation for these patterns is code reusability and easier maintenance. Code shouldn’t break after adjusting a single line. Also, extending the functionality shouldn’t need a big refactor.

Don’t try to reinvent the wheel: Design patterns are tested and tried solutions, so they are probably useful for you too. It’s a universal toolkit: They are motivated by general principles and allow you to think and frame problems in new ways. They help to see the bigger picture by abstracting the problem specifics. Understand other code more easily: The recognition of patterns can help read other code. Patterns encipher intent, so it might reveal why code was designed that way. A way to communicate design ideas concisely.: Using a common language can simplify communication among developers. This is what lingo should be used for: precise communication of complex ideas.

It doesn’t remain abstract but instead tries to relate it to practice. I found the real-world analogies to the patterns sometimes quite amusing. Moreover, the book has a clear structure for each design. It starts with a problem that the pattern addresses. The pattern structure is explained (with UML diagram), and pseudo-code is given. Moreover, the book comes with source code for solutions in several common languages (Python, C++, Go, Java, Swift…). It not only mentions when to use it but also when to not use it. Finally, the relationship with other patterns is laid out. This is useful to distinguish patterns with a similar structure, but it also mentions how they might be combined. I find it very didactic to connect the newly learned content.

Each day, I read about two to three patterns. I then went through a source-code implementation to understand the language’s specifics and make the constructs more relatable. I focused on Python but always glimpsed at the Go solution to learn about its language specialties. Also, the author of the Go solutions was a bit more creative with the hypothetical problems :) After that, I thought about a problem by myself and how I could apply the pattern. I then implemented a sketchy solution in Python. This was definitely the most time-intensive part, but I believe that it is crucial for learning. Tell me and I forget, teach me and I remember, involve me and I learn. Sidenote: If you want to learn more about the origin of this Confucian wisdom, check here.
