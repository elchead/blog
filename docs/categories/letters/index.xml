I&amp;rsquo;m happy to miss out on all the events and parties that are happening in Berlin right now.
Joy of missing out means relishing to stay in, enjoying your own company, and getting to work on your own projects

Why? Because I&amp;rsquo;m an introvert. I refuel energy by being alone.</description></item><item><title>Finding mental peace with planning</title><link>https://astobbe.me/letters/mental-peace/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://astobbe.me/letters/mental-peace/</guid><description>When giving a todo planner to my friends birthday the other day, I was asked if I am super organized and into this &amp;ldquo;GTD&amp;rdquo; (Getting Things Done) thing. After affirming it, we talked about how it helps to get all thoughts out of the mind, because everything is captured in the system.

I love how personal and introspective her thoughts and shared experiences are. I&amp;rsquo;ve started journaling last year, but my thoughts are mostly very raw and hidden to the outside world. By starting a public journal, I want to challenge myself to become more open and overcome the imposter that my thoughts are not worth being shared.</description></item><item><title>Thinking out loud</title><link>https://astobbe.me/letters/thinking-out-loud/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://astobbe.me/letters/thinking-out-loud/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not used to talking about feelings and raw thoughts. It&amp;rsquo;s how I grew up and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to undo. Feelings make you vulnerable and I saw them as a burden to others. So I mostly kept them to myself. I found ways to process them: by studying, listening to music, exercising and sleeping. Basically, disengaging from my feelings and letting time heal everything. Time alleviates strong emotions. But I think that this evasive way also disconnects myself from people.</description></item></channel></rss>
