I love how personal and introspective her thoughts and shared experiences are. I&amp;rsquo;ve started journaling last year, but my thoughts are mostly very raw and hidden to the outside world. By starting a public journal, I want to challenge myself to become more open and overcome the imposter that my thoughts are not worth being shared.</description></item></channel></rss>
