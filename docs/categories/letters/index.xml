The others already knew each other and kept talking about that new company building in another city and contract details. So exciting, right? It was hard to step in and change topics, so I kept silent. Eventually, I asked the guy sitting opposite about his work. But he did not really seem to enjoy talking about it, so I gave up and went back to work.</p>
<p>What went wrong? They certainly did not show much interest or effort to integrate me into their group, but that&rsquo;s outside my control and I could have certainly done better than mostly staying silent.</p>
<p>My approach to good talk is usually to explore interests and look for some common ground. Out of my curiosity, I usually find something interesting and start asking questions. Actually, this is what I enjoy about talking to strangers. It&rsquo;s new territory - so much to explore (except for some boring exceptions).</p>
<p>I used to struggle how to start new conversations.
It was a real eye-opener for me to realize just how blind I am to details.
I learnt that great talkers are observant and watch for cues: the catchy T-shirt, their book, a particular behavior you share&hellip; These cues are super helpful, because they might indicate some common ground, letting you skip ahead the boring small talk right away.
Curiosity is also key. Even behind simple questions about why someone did something this way might reveal something interesting.
Recently on a friend&rsquo;s birthday, a girl asked me why I would gift a todo-planner. The others were probably just thinking: &ldquo;Oh he is german&rdquo;. We discovered that her boyfriend is also a follower of the GTD philosophy and that we share many quirks. It was great to discover this, since it&rsquo;s rare to find such people.</p>
<p>Besides asking questions, providing cues is also essential.
Only if I reveal something about myself, can the other person take cues from it and ask good questions.
This is still something I struggle with. I often only start talking when asked, but not out of own initiative.
It&rsquo;s a past behavior I need to unlearn. It&rsquo;s a good thing, as long as I don&rsquo;t go to deep into the weeds and just provide it as a cue.
I want to become more thoughtful to share something from my day. I started last year to look for storyworthy moments every day, but I still have difficulties to find that moment. To often that short great moment succumbs to the more mundane but longer lasting / more recent events.
I want to try to frame my day as a story. To capture these moments mentally as highlights of my story when they are happening and not just when asked or at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Another dimension of good conversations is humor. I admire humor in other people, but I used to believe that its just not a trait of me.
Derek Sivers description of humor made me see it in new light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humor means using your mind beyond necessity, beyond reality, for both noticing and imagining. It shows you quickly looked at something from many angles, found the one that amused you the most, and considerately expressed it to someone else.</p>
<p><cite>- How To Live, Derek Sivers </cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really much something that is learnable. I don&rsquo;t want to be a comedian, but I can learn to be more observant and express things from an unusual perspective.</p>

I rarely disagree, because I would not change their beliefs and just cause conflicts. In delicate situations, I would almost never speak up and help someone in public.</p>
<p>Let me be concrete.
Last week, a drunk / drugged man, who did not wear a mask, was continously coughing on the metro. He did not even use the crook of his arm against the germ spreading. The man sitting opposite just shook his head and sighed in disbelief, but did not do anything. I was sitting next to the coughing guy, just shaking my head with the indignant opposite doing nothing. This guy was not just risking my health but also that of others.
I later thought how I could have changed something about it. The most tactful way and probably the most effective with someone drugged who doesn&rsquo;t speak my language well would have been to kindly offer a mask.
I didn&rsquo;t have a spare one this day, but now I have for cases like these. Another day on the metro, I actually observed how relieved a young lady without mask was after being offered one.</p>
<p>In other cases, like people smoking or listening to loud music it&rsquo;s more tolerable, it&rsquo;s just disturbing but not harmful. The risk of getting myself into trouble is not always worth the small benefit.
But even there I want to show more civil courage, especially with young kids.</p>
<p>I am still puzzled how to have an impact and not just sound ridiculous in many situations like kids asking me to buy cigarettes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about being political. I used to think that politics is just about government decisions that are largely disconnected from our individual lives. But now I believe that being political means standing up for matters whose impact is bigger than just myself.</p>
<h2 id="speak-up-and-ask-questions">Speak up and ask questions</h2>
<p>A kurdic barber told me the other day how after asking questions he got some of his muslim clients to stop their religious practice. Not by preaching, but by asking questions.
My girl told me how she changed her parents view on vegan diet from completely rejecting it as unhealthy and cult towards eating lots of vegan food. Something similar happened with another friend from a conservative family.</p>
<p>I have lots of such political situations as well, but in the past I remained silent because I thought I could not change them. Now, my goal isn&rsquo;t to change anymore. Changing someone&rsquo;s view is outside my control.
My dad might never want to eat this vegan stuff, but I can make him understand why people do it and get rid of his repugnance.
I just want speak up and express how I think. Not to preach, but to ask questions, to offer a new perspective.
That is the best I can do, this is who I want to be.</p>

I&rsquo;m happy to miss out on all the events and parties that are happening in Berlin right now.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Why? Because I&rsquo;m an introvert. I refuel energy by being alone. I get to reflect, be grateful, get new ideas, get to plan how to spend my time meaningfully with those important to me and how to express the love I feel for them.</p>
<p>I rarely suffer from FOMO, because I got to accept how limited my energy is. I know that it&rsquo;s good for me to spend lots of time alone: learning, working on projects, journaling, meditating, exercising, reading&hellip;
It makes me a more interesting person, because that&rsquo;s where I get most ideas and knowledge from.</p>
<p>Saying no to most things makes me someone who has clear values and priorities.
It reserves the energy to be good at what really matters to me.
I want to go deeper with what I already have. I still have many &ldquo;Baustellen&rdquo;: becoming more grateful, loving, mindful and disciplined.
I want to find more time for reading. I want to get better at capturing ideas and making notes. I want to express and share more of my thoughts and learning.
I want to invest in relationships. Restricting myself to only a few important people but really getting to know them.
I want to find time for learning. I don&rsquo;t find much time for learning projects at the moment. I want to get better at dancing. I want to keep practicing the ukulele consistently.</p>

It might sound cynical and egoistic, but I think it has a stoic truth. You need to be happy with yourself to give to others. I acknowledge that there are benevolent and giving people who put others first, but I know that I can&rsquo;t give long-term and wholeheartedly when my needs are not fullfilled. #maslows-pyramid
Anything other than yourself might be taken away at any time: friends and family, money, your belongings, your home&hellip;
When my well-being does not depend on external conditions, it&rsquo;s resilient so that I can focus on giving to others.</p>

After affirming it, we talked about how it helps to get all thoughts out of the mind, because everything is captured in the system.
Whenever, I think of a question, a gift idea, something I want do or commit to do, I track it. Ideally I do it right after, but I am still not systematic enough in my capturing (working on it!).
My problem is that I am not yet disciplined enough to only focus on one thing and finish it before moving on. It&rsquo;s yet another reason to practice meditation - to observe thoughts and regain focus.</p>
<p>People ask why am I so meticulous about it and why I would want to be so systematic (unnatural). For one, it&rsquo;s a life philosophy to be more intentional.
I plan to stay aligned with my priorities and to ease my mind. I used to worry and think a lot about how to do things and if nothing slipped through. Now, my calendar and todo app tell me what should be done today. That&rsquo;s why I do weekly reviews and why I want to plan the next day ahead. To free my mind from organizing when I want to focus on my priorities of the day.
Does this mean that I am not spontonaeous? No, I am not rigid about plans, they are just a guide. On an unplanned day, the mind does what is comfortable in the moment. And usually it&rsquo;s the <a href="/posts/shortsighted-me/" rel="">shortsighted me</a> that wins in these instances.</p>
<p>Another thing that really drains my mental energy is decision making. Even trivial decisions such as choosing food, in what order to do things are exhausting.
As a morning person, my energy levels are high early in the day and low in the late afternoon. So the later part of the day is also when I make bad decisions. Especially if they are spontaneous.
I try to defer these decisions to a moment where I can clearly think and not feel pressured.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let “No” be the default answer. People mistakenly say yes to work, people, and places they don’t like, then need to escape to get away from their mistakes. People make bad decisions because they felt they had to decide. It would have been wiser to do nothing.</p>
<p>When someone asks you to decide, just refuse. The longer you go without deciding, the more information is revealed. Eventually, the choice is obvious and made without an agonizing decision.</p>
<p>&ndash; <cite>Derek Sivers, How To Live</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, I am experimenting with a decision making blocker where I batch non-trivial decisions. In a calm moment, I then go over them. I am saying experimenting, because it&rsquo;s hard to change such fundamental things that I used to differently for so many years. I want to stack it with my journaling routine during my <a href="https://www.insider.com/tired-all-day-but-energy-before-bed-2019-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">energy peak before sleep</a>. I first heard about this peak on the <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Huberman Lab podcast</a> and want to explore more what triggers it and at what time it happens.</p>

I love how personal and introspective her thoughts and shared experiences are.
I&rsquo;ve started <a href="/posts/building-a-journaling-habit-with-obsidian/" rel="">journaling last year</a>, but my thoughts are mostly very raw and hidden to the outside world. By starting a public journal, I want to challenge myself to become more open and overcome the imposter that my thoughts are not worth being shared.</p>
<p>I am still figuring out the format, if it will be weekly or daily. But my goal is to share my learnings and thoughts at least once per week.</p>
<p>You will find my entries <a href="/categories/letters/" rel="">here</a>.</p>

It&rsquo;s how I grew up and it&rsquo;s hard to undo. Feelings make you vulnerable and I saw them as a burden to others. So I mostly kept them to myself. I found ways to process them: by studying, listening to music, exercising and sleeping. Basically, disengaging from my feelings and letting time heal everything. Time alleviates strong emotions.
But I think that this evasive way also disconnects myself from people. I blunt emotions, but don&rsquo;t solve the root cause.
It&rsquo;s because talking about feelings and problems is sensitive.
But I learnt that when <a href="/books/crucial-conversations" rel="">approached tactfully</a>, everything can be talked about. And I think there is much more to gain than to lose.
You get to know someone else’s perspective and either discover that you both felt something was wrong and want to fix it, or you find that the other does not care that much. I think even the latter is so valuable to know!</p>
<p>It actually feels so bonding when you can talk about it and feel understood. I admit that it&rsquo;s not easy to find your soul mate. Most people just don&rsquo;t care so deeply. I feel grateful that I found my significant other, but you can actually rediscover deep connections in people you already know. Don&rsquo;t assume that they don&rsquo;t want it, just because it wasn&rsquo;t like this before! When you start opening up, you might be surprised what you get back. I certainly reaped rewards.</p>
<p>One reason that deterred me from sharing was that raw thoughts and feelings are not stable. They might change tomorrow and what I said yesterday would feel like a lie.
So I only used to share results and facts. This is a good thing with more distant acquaintances. You don&rsquo;t want to confuse them with your wild mind. But with good friends and loved ones, it is so rewarding to think out loud. First, you get to understand each other much better. Second, you have much more interesting conversations and third you might discover something new. You get to learn different perspectives and can make better decisions!</p>
<p>Lately, I had been thinking about moving out from home again. Normally, I would only share the news with my family when I already made the decision and probably already found a flat. This time however, I shared the idea early with my aunt and it turns out that she is super supportive and actually knew of an awesome flat that will become available soon. Serendipity at it&rsquo;s best! Soon, I&rsquo;ll be moving in - thanks to thinking out loud.</p>
<p>It’s natural for thoughts and feelings to change. Sharing what we think in the moment is actually very honest, the exact opposite of what I believed. It’s honest to acknowledge that our thoughts are not always clear-cut and logical. Not every word needs to be taken literally. You are talking to a friend, not an interrogator. Over time we gain more information and more perspective, so it’s healthy to associate change with improvement instead of constantly fearing that we act inconsistently and worrying that we think differently tomorrow. It feels great to not be alone on this endless thought journey and it immensely enriches both experiences and learnings. As I’m writing this, I’m just thinking out loud. It needn’t be perfect, it’s just me.</p>
