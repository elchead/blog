I love how personal and introspective her thoughts and shared experiences are. I&amp;rsquo;ve started journaling last year, but my thoughts are mostly very raw and hidden to the outside world. By starting a public journal, I want to challenge myself to become more open and overcome the imposter that my thoughts are not worth being shared.</description></item><item><title>Thinking out loud</title><link>https://astobbe.me/letters/thinking-out-loud/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://astobbe.me/letters/thinking-out-loud/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not used to talking about feelings and raw thoughts. It&amp;rsquo;s how I grew up and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to undo. Feelings make you vulnerable and I saw them as a burden to others. So I mostly kept them to myself. I found ways to process them: by studying, listening to music, exercising and sleeping. Basically, disengaging from my feelings and letting time heal everything. Time alleviates strong emotions. But I think that this evasive way also disconnects myself from people.</description></item></channel></rss>
