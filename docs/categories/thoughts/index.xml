I&rsquo;m late in the game, but I want to share my goals for this year with you.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>My fuckups of 2021</title><link>https://astobbe.me/posts/fuckups-2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://astobbe.me/posts/fuckups-2021/</guid><description>The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing - Henry Ford.

In reality, nothing has meaning, the world is just full of events obeying the laws of the universe. These laws constrain how we live: time is finite and irreversible, gravity puts us on the ground, physical needs ensure survial, etc. But beyond that everything is really up to our minds. We are all born within this frame, but over time we all have different experiences.</description></item></channel></rss>
