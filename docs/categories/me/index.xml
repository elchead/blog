Back then the predominant schools were Stoicisim, Epicureaunism and Cynicism. Around the same time, we are talking about 500 BC, Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism developed in Asia. With the rise of the world religions their popularity declined, but they have remained till today and so has the foundational value of having life principles.
Yet none of these ancient philosophy, have convinced me to become a full-hearted adopter.</p>
<p>Inspired by the readings of <a href="books/stoic-joy/" rel="">Stoic joy</a> and <a href="/books/how-to-live/" rel="">How to live</a>, I decided to go on my quest to define my life philosophy. Motivated by <a href="/books/principles/" rel="">Principles</a>, I am making them public for everyone to see.</p>
<p>The first question is: what makes up a life philosophy?
For me, it&rsquo;s the core of beliefs that guide what I do, how I make decisions and how I spend my energy and time.
It&rsquo;s not a definition of lofty goals or beliefs that every good-natured human holds - you may assume this about me ;) My life philosohpy is about those principles that define the core of my identity and deserve explanation by not being obvious.
It&rsquo;s the set of principels I hold now, but that are amendable to future changes.</p>
<p>I seperate these principles into doing and being. Doing relates to my actions and how I spend my energy. Being relates to my personality, thinking, beliefs and choices.</p>
<h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<h3 id="say-no">Say no</h3>
<p>Say no to work, people and places you don&rsquo;t like. Be reluctant to commit. Say you come back later to make a decision. Most bad decisions are made impulsively under pressure.</p>
<p>The more you take on, the less you will achieve.</p>
<p>Think twice before comitting to a plan. Even if it feels like &ldquo;hell yeah&rdquo; it&rsquo;s often worth to give it another thought when you feel less emotional about it. Everything seems more important in the moment. Write it down for later. Time tells how things really are.</p>
<p>It seems appealing to do x, to learn y, but what&rsquo;s the cost for your other priorities? Would you enjoy the process, or do you just want the outcome?</p>
<p>There are too many options. Commit.</p>
<h3 id="time-is-precious">Time is precious</h3>
<p>Time is limited an you don&rsquo;t want to regret not having had enough time for what really matters.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t watch movies, TV series or shows and don&rsquo;t play games. It&rsquo;s not a good use of time. If I do it&rsquo;s to socialize with friends as an exception.</p>
<p>Money can save time: by saving commute time, paying for the extra service, delegating tasks that are not a good time investment.</p>
<p>Respect other people&rsquo;s time and make an effort to be a good communicator.</p>
<p>Traditional 9 to 5 jobs go against the appreciation of time. It does not align with our own schedule and energy to be productive and measures work by time, when it should really be measured by value.
Are we really productive long-term working 8 or more hours?
Rather prefer to get a bit done every day.</p>
<h3 id="constant-learning">Constant learning</h3>
<p>A day without learning is a lost opportunity.</p>
<p>Be curious and unfearful of looking &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mistakes are an opportunity to learn. Record them and review them.</p>
<p>Ask for critique.</p>
<p>Learning is broad: technical skills, soft skills, understanding thinking and feelings of others, self-reflection..</p>
<p>Learning is the path to growth, it empowers, and is the seed for positive change.</p>
<p>Share your knowledge - through writing on the internet, open source projects. It might be useful to someone else. And what is knowledge worth if not shared / applied?</p>
<h3 id="get-wealthy">Get wealthy</h3>
<p>Provide value to society. Creating value without asking for anything in return is unsustainable.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sell yourself under value. Income is the path to financial freedom. <a href="#Time%20is%20precious" rel=""></a> and wealth is conditional to decide how to spend most of your time.</p>
<p>Wealth is money not spent. Stay a <a href="#Humble%20minimalist" rel=""></a>.</p>
<p>Reject the comfort of a steady paycheck. <a href="#Take%20reasonable%20risks" rel=""></a> and jump on opportunities.</p>
<p>Do what comes easily to you.</p>
<p>Settle for average returns from passive index funds.</p>
<p>Your home is an expense, not an investment.</p>
<h3 id="take-action">Take action</h3>
<p>Happiness is solving good problems.</p>
<p>Living up to ones core values manifests through action, not talking.</p>
<p>People try to explain the world, but the point is to change the world.
Ideas without execution are worthless.</p>
<p>A great speech can do the work of a thousand soldiers. Change minds. Speak up.</p>
<p>Suspend judgement from the first draft. Something bad can be improved upon. You can&rsquo;t improve nothing.</p>
<p>Wait to release a finished work. Move on to the next thing first, to feel less affected by public opinion. Their comments are about your past work.</p>
<h2 id="being">Being</h2>
<h3 id="plan-and-be-intentional">Plan and be intentional</h3>
<p>Planning is time not spent doing, so don&rsquo;t overdo it, but doing without planning is time poorly spent.
Plan your day ahead to not be distracted by the unimportant and impulses during the day.</p>
<p>As an introvert, reserve time for yourself. You can&rsquo;t be your best version for extended periods without time to step back and reconnect with yourself.</p>
<p>Schedule your day to &ldquo;act according to the goals of your highest self, not your passing mood.&rdquo; - How to live, Derek Sivers
Schedule quality time with friends, reserve focused time to learn, do preventative health checkups.</p>
<p>Rely on routines to lower the need for willpower. Willpower is limited.</p>
<p>Practice self-control to avoid impulses that distract me from my bigger priorities. Resist sweets, checking the phone, urge to escape discomfort once in a while. Prove to yourself you can.</p>
<p>Review your intentions and priorities in the afternoon when self-control is low.</p>
<p>Meet people out of curiosity and care not because it&rsquo;s been a while. Set an intention.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-thinking">Long term thinking</h3>
<p>Avoid indulging in activities that trade short term benefits against the long term. Your energy and time should be investments: be it learning, work, finance, but importantly also relationships and friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I only want to be around people that I know I’m going to be around with for the rest of my life. I only want to work on things that I know have long-term payout. - \cite{Naval Ravikant}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say no to what seems appealing in the moment. There is no free lunch. Junk food and sweets gives instant gratification while paying for how you feel later and your long-term health.</p>
<p>Food that tastes good is bad for you, and vice-versa. Eat to feel good rather than eating yummy to feel bad.</p>
<h3 id="filter-and-focus">Filter and focus</h3>
<p>Focus on the relevant. Most gossip and daily news are not worth knowing.</p>
<p>Do what you do whole-heartedly. Choose full attention to detail over absent-mindedness.</p>
<p>Find your skill to master. &ldquo;Mastery is a long-term pursuit, an investment that avoids the distraction of temporary impulses. You spend time intentionally. People don&rsquo;t fail by choosing the wrong path - they fail by not choosing. Passion comes after you start getting good.&rdquo; - How to live, Derek Sivers</p>
<p>Focus your energy on a few friends rather than spreading it over a dozen.
Cut ties with people that don&rsquo;t align with your values.</p>
<h3 id="dont-cave-in---no-regrets">Don&rsquo;t cave in - no regrets</h3>
<p>Resist the pressure to conform and do things because of societies expectations.</p>
<p>Embrace to be an outsider who deviates from the norm.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t follow external expectations, you will only lament later how all of it did not really matter. Don&rsquo;t take life too seriously. People usually care less and we are the strictest with ourselves.</p>
<p>Ask what you want. Learn to be rejected. Do what you want now and don&rsquo;t postpone it for later. Later extends until it&rsquo;s too late. Take reasonable risks.</p>
<p>Expect the worst. It&rsquo;s outside your control how much time you have with loved ones, but you can enjoy the present and express gratitude today.</p>
<p>Visualizing the worst, avoids later regrets, because it makes you appreciate the now.</p>
<h3 id="before-adding-try-subtracting">Before adding, try subtracting</h3>
<p>New things promise some upside, but what about the downsides? Addiction, scattered focus, wasted time..</p>
<p>Try not to fix things by swallowing that pill, but instead remove what is causing the pain.</p>
<p>Less is more.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to be more right. Just be less wrong.
Before adding niceties, avoid doing harm first. One terrible thing can destroy an entire relationship.
Most of being a good person is not doing bad.</p>
<h3 id="humble--minimalist">Humble &amp; minimalist</h3>
<p>Have as few possessions as possible. Anything additional is baggage. Keep it easy to move places and don&rsquo;t be fixated to belongings.</p>
<p>Happiness is a state without desires.</p>
<p>Minimize your dependencies. Reject consumerism and materialism. It doesn&rsquo;t bring happiness, but just leads to a never ending spiral of desire for more.</p>
<p>By stoic ideals, appreciate what you have. Don&rsquo;t admire rich people, but pity them for their high standards to feel happy.
Being minimalistic means there is less to lose.</p>
<p>Be frugal to become financially independent. Spending money doesn&rsquo;t make happy, but freedom of choice does. Aspire to work because it&rsquo;s meaningful, not to pay the bills.</p>
<h3 id="live-with-nature">Live with nature</h3>
<p>Appreciate our natural habit. Preserve its beauty by foremost minimizing harm. Not to the extreme of severly compromising life quality, but by avoiding the unnecessary and compensating for the accepted burden. Avoid, reduce, compensate - in that order.</p>
<p>Move to a quiet place with lots of nature. Enjoy the surroundings.
Nature is healing. It&rsquo;s a reminder of what is too much in cities.</p>
<p>Care about the other animals on the planet. Eat mostly vegetables.</p>
<h3 id="live-for-others">Live for others</h3>
<p>Be a good listener, ask deep questions. Nobody asks because most are not interested. Curiosity comes from the attitude that everybody has something to learn from. Don&rsquo;t fake interest.</p>
<p>Most of us are caught in our head, but make the effort to feel and think how they do. There is plenty of time to think for yourself in solitude. Be present.</p>
<p>When talking, don&rsquo;t dwell on telling how great you are. Focus on being helpful to others. Share what you know and might be relevant to them. Make them feel great. Most people don&rsquo;t care about how happy I am or how passionate or proud I am of x. Admiration and appreciation comes from decency and deeds.
Talking is the chance to learn and to give to others.</p>
<p>Do something to help people without self-interest.</p>
<p>People with strong social ties are happier.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t hear enough compliments. Tell people when you think something nice about them.</p>
<h3 id="love-and-feel">Love and feel</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The first step to love is to give it your full attention and deliberately appreciate it&rdquo; - How to live, Derek Sivers</p>
<p>Be wary of marriage. Dont make a life-long commitment based on an emotional state.</p>
<p>Love your partner more than your children. This is how they learn what love is.</p>
<p>Learn about people to empathize with them. Humans love to be understood. Don&rsquo;t just try to fix problems. Listen and understand their feelings.</p>
<p>You can only feel loved if you choose to  <a href="#Be%20honest" rel=""></a> and are your true self.</p>
<p>Notice who brings out the best in you and makes you feel more connected  with yourself.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to impress. Impress yourself.</p>
<p>Admit what you are really feeling, even when it&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<h3 id="friends">Friends</h3>
<p>Make time for your relationships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live among fellow freaks, where obsession is normal and ambition is rewarded&rdquo; - How to live, Derek Sivers</p>
<p>Keep friends at a healthy distance. Get close to truly know and care about each other but not too close to become dependent.
Sincere appreciation and engagement with their interests is the foundation for friendship.</p>
<p><a href="#Long%20term%20thinking" rel=""></a> also applies to friends. Meet regularly to maintain and continously grow the connection.</p>
<p>Open to friends when you need emotional support for a hard decision or during a tough time.</p>
<h3 id="be-honest">Be honest</h3>
<p>I avoid environments where I need to watch what I say. I am honest in my words and actions. There is no higher quality than trustworthiness and integrity. I want to rely on people and in return I commit to keep my word.</p>
<p>I admit own mistakes and apologize.</p>
<p>Always say the truth, taking the painful consequences. What could excuse an exception?</p>
<h3 id="pursue-pain">Pursue pain</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s worthy comes with pain: love comes with attachment, success comes with frustration and failures, deep connection comes from being vulnerable, exploration comes with fear. Make pain a choice rather than seeing it as necessary evil.</p>
<p>Asking what you want comes with the potential pain of being rejected.</p>
<p>Being honest is uncomfortable and painful for our self-image, to others. It might mean accepting a punishment. But defering the truth is much more painful.</p>
<h3 id="reinvent-yourself-regularly">Reinvent yourself regularly</h3>
<p>Change becomes difficult after age 25. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CR_zUWwIyfg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Neuroplasiticty</a> decreases afterwards.
Invest in your early personal growth.</p>
<p>Personalities are fluid.
Don’t stick to past traits just because that’s how people know you.</p>
<p>Change the way you act, look and talk.</p>
<h3 id="accept-and-take-responsibility">Accept and take responsibility</h3>
<p>Embrace the present how it is. When something bothers you, find the causing belief and and change it.</p>
<p>Many unfortunate events are outside your control. You can only control your reaction to them.</p>
<p>If you fail to pursue what you want, it&rsquo;s because of you. Don&rsquo;t compare yourself with other more fortunate individuals. There are even more people who are less fortunate.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask &ldquo;why did this happen to me&rdquo;. Everyone has their own burden. Do your best.</p>
<p>Taking responsibility instead of pin pointing to others feels empowering. You are in control.</p>
<h3 id="life-is-storyworthy">Life is storyworthy</h3>
<p>Every day pick a moment that is storyworthy. See life as a story. Stories are the remains of an experience. Make great adventures, but tell greater stories.</p>
<p>Journal every day.</p>
<p>A long and healthy life you can&rsquo;t remember is not worth much.</p>
<p>Pursue novelty: India, Bruning Man, Skydive, Scuba dive. Live in different places. Change your work environment.</p>

<p>2022 is maybe the most exciting year so far.
I spent January still on my Erasmus semester in Barcelona. I had exams this month, but I still made time to explore new things. I had my first deprivation tank experience, tried light therapy glasses and went to a magic show by <a href="https://www.luispardo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Luis Pardo</a>.
<figure>

</p>
<p>I challenged myself to talk to a stranger every day: and found out that most people actually enjoy small talk. It opens for serendipity: I got to meet a guy on the subway who is from the same small town in Cadiz where I would go in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Living in places, not as a tourist, but by staying there for some time, is how I like to explore.
After Beijing, Munich and Barcelona, I decided to go for my first digital nomad experience.
I went to Cadiz in the sunny south of Spain for about 4 weeks. I loved the proximity to the sea in Barcelona, but I wanted to explore a more tranquile and nature-based place.
A free room in an apartment with a charming lady in her fifties (it&rsquo;s rude to ask the age right) brought me to El Puerto de Santa Maria. A small town at the coast line facing the peninsula of the city Cadiz. I am happy I did it and I learned a few things about myself and on how I want to live:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This year, I lived my first month as a digital nomad in Spain, Cadiz.<br>I lived in a small town called El puerto in a shared flat with an older lady. These are my takeaways:</p>&mdash; Adrian Stobbe (@astobbe_) <a href="https://twitter.com/astobbe_/status/1500104636090531854?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I did a windsurf course, enjoyed bathing in the sea in the late afternoon, and taking walks.
I hope I documented more of my experience, but I particularly remember the horse riding day with Johanna and the day at the beautiful, mostly untouched beach in Los Caños de Meca. My nice host Lola proposed the trip and brought me and my friends Stefan and Juno from the windsurf course there by car (you need a car in Andalusia!).
I remember the adventurous mountain trip to a beautiful lagoon in Algeciras with Hector and the monkey day at the rock of Gibraltar.</p>
<p><figure>

</p>
<p>At the end of the month, I returned to Munich for an exam and got to see my friends again. I truly enjoyed my days with them and realized how my friendships had improved. I went skiing for the first time in my life with my old school friend Maxi.</p>
<figure>
</figure>

<p>And March was yet another great month. I got back to my family in Berlin and enjoyed Urban sports to the fullest. I went to lots of dancing classes, swimming, to the gym + sauna and I went on a bouldering date with a special person.
On this date, I met a midwestern girl that for the first time ever gave me the feeling of a soulmate. We think alike in so many ways: the curiosity to explore new places and perspectives, being intentional, the desire for deep connection&hellip; I could go on, but I spare you the rest.
I got hella lucky to meet this girl on a dating app: Bumble (yeah did not expect this neither).
We bonded in no time and everything just seemed right.
In June I went to see her family in the U.S. and had a wonderful time. I was surprised to find bigger cultural differences than I expected and changed my perspective on how I want to treat my family and see my friends. I learned a lot about <a href="https://astobbe.me/letters/love-and-feel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my emotions</a> and the value of <a href="https://astobbe.me/letters/thinking-out-loud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">thinking out loud</a>.
My highlights were the days at the family&rsquo;s cabin by a lake, and the camping night at Lake Superior.
Shaped by the car dependence in the U.S. and earlier in Cadiz, I was more determined than ever to get my driver&rsquo;s license and finally started when I got back.
In June, I also moved into my own flat in the heart of Berlin. Growing up in the suburbs of Berlin, its quite another experience to live in the most buzzing place and getting everywhere within much fewer time. Shortened commute time is worth a lot, because commute often was an impediment to go out in the first place. Now I miss the greenery at times, but you can&rsquo;t have it all. As I recently learned, Berlin is one of the greenest cities in Europe, so I just need to take advantage of the many parks.</p>
<h2 id="status-update-of-my-life-areas-and-goals">Status update of my life areas and goals</h2>
<h3 id="life">Life</h3>
<p>I appreciate to be close to my family, because I know it won&rsquo;t be permanent. I feel fortunate to live by mself in a place that is so close to work and central. A wonderful human being entered my life this year and I am learning so much about my emotions and childhood distortions (nothing dramatic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFKzE52XRmw&amp;ab_channel=TheSchoolofLife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">everyone has them</a> 😉 ).</p>
<p>After my thesis submission, I want to consciously take more time to do things I tend to put off because x needs to be done first. I want to live my life today and not postpone it to the future.
I want to try new things, do trips, invest in deep friendships, visit the people I care about.</p>
<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
<p>I set the goal to do 7 learning projects this year.
So far, I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>finish my <a href="https://github.com/elchead/people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">first offline PWA (progressive web app)</a>: I am still not 100% happy with the app and it has some issues on Safari iOS lately. I&rsquo;m thinking about switching to Obsidian, but the learning experience with Typescript and PWA features was the main motivation.</li>
<li>learn rust: read <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Rust in Action</a>; completed all <a href="https://github.com/elchead/rustlings-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rustlings exercises</a></li>
<li>went to <a href="https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">We are devs</a> conference. I realized that I miss out on a lot of events in my tech sphere, because I don&rsquo;t keep myself up-to-date. I found out too late that KubeCon was in Valencia this year. I would have loved to go. I want to stay more informed through Twitter (how I found we are devs), maybe LinkedIn and tech communities (meetup? online?). If you have any recommendations, please tell me :)</li>
<li>continue Uncle Bobs <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/clean-code-fundamentals/9780134661742/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Clean Code Fundamentals</a> video course: it&rsquo;s highly entertaining and I have lots to learn. I stopped watching the course due to thesis pressure and other priorities, but I want to continue, refine my notes and eventually share them on the blog</li>
</ul>
<p>I am interested to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>practice my vim / IDE shorcut skills. I want to explore another IDE than VS Code that has more powerful refactoring and automation capabilities (thinking of Jetbrains)</li>
<li>explore optimizations in the terminal. Starting last year, I leveled up my terminal with oh-my-zsh and some nice plugins, but I am still not using it to the fullest. I know about fzf but I don&rsquo;t use it. Here are <a href="https://github.com/elchead/dotfiles/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my dotfiles</a>. If you have any plugin recommendation, please reach out :) I am also curious on the <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">warp project</a> and might try it out</li>
<li>learn about web3: the space and innovations going on.. On the tech side, I want to learn about substrate and polkadot. I visited a <a href="https://substrate.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">substrate</a> workshop earlier and want to get involved in a project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="habits">Habits</h3>
<p>I see habits as the empowerment for positive change. Taking a learning hour off in the morning is the first step to reach my goal on the learning projects. Setting a rule to get to bed by 22.30 pm is my condition for a good start of the day and being productive.
Yet, I am not particularily consistent.
The only habit I am fairly consistent with is practicing Ukulele: it takes only few minutes and is fun.
As part of my <a href="https://astobbe.me/posts/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">yearly goals</a>, I decided to do a sweet free month and failed. My longest streak was 7 days, because of single days where I failed (also due to social pressure ^^). I only recorded 32 sweet free days this year until know.</p>
<p>My most important habit is journaling and while I almost always do it in the morning, the more important day reflection is in the evening, where I often fail. Mostly, I lack energy and am not in thinking mood. I need to take my winddown routine (yoga streching, meditation, chill music) more seriously. I also recently discovered<a href="https://twitter.com/astobbe_/status/1552346810974408706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"> iPhone + keyboard </a> as a good mobile combination that works on public transport and avoids big bright light before going to bed. I just bought a stand for my iPhone - let&rsquo;s see how that goes.
I generally find myself to have low self-discipline in the evening (quite understandably as a morning person..) and often also don&rsquo;t go to bed on time.</p>
<p>As a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be persistent with not allowing distractions in the morning. No phone in the morning (until 10am at least)</li>
<li>I need to acknowledge my low self-discipline at night and rely more on my sleep reminder to tell me to winddown. I want to incorporate yoga streching to see if it helps with sleep. I also experimented with theanine, but it seems to make me feel very sleepy in the morning and live stronger dreams. I want to sleep by 22.30 pm latest.</li>
<li>I want to meditate every day.</li>
<li>I want to try the no-sweet challenge again</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p>I already wrote 9 blog plosts this year, 8 letters and published 5 book notes. This is more than last year, and I also got two positive feedbacks from strangers so far. I recently started tracking my blog analytics and found out that I get some fair traffic from Google and most of it on my <a href="https://astobbe.me/posts/building-a-journaling-habit-with-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Obsidian article on Journaling</a>. So far, I&rsquo;ve been mostly writing for myself and I want to keep it that way. However, I want to practice my writing style and build a small audience.</p>
<p>Inspired by Jen Vermet, I am thinking of joining the <a href="https://writeofpassage.school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Write of Passage</a> (if I get a scholarship). I also want to get some tips and feedback from writing friends. Maybe, I would like to be more active in an online-community. I recently joined <a href="https://nesslabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Nesslabs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
<p>Say no. I still find myself comitting and saying yes to things I don&rsquo;t want. Don&rsquo;t make spontaneous, impulsive decision-making. Rather defer it and think about it in a quiet moment.</p>
<p>Being over doing. I feel I constantly have to do something. But sometimes it&rsquo;s just nice to be with myself and feel my emotions. I often catch myself escaping my emotions.</p>
<p>Procrastination is a natural protection. I constantly tend to put too much stuff on my todos. I don&rsquo;t need to feel bad that I can&rsquo;t do it all. Many of it, feels exciting or important in the moment, but if it is really important to me just shows when I gain more distance from the thought. Do less and fully engage in what I do.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make it too delicious. I want to eat to feel good afterwards not to feel good in the moment. I often tend to eat too much in a single meal and feel tired afterwards. Eating something less delicious (usually also more healthy..) helps to eat for my health instead of against it.</p>
<p>Coffee is a potent drug for me. I get into highly focused states and have almost ecstatic levels of happiness at times. I need to be careful with it because it also causes diarrea (caffeine increases colonic activity..) and it seems to have a very long half life for me, which can interfere with my sleep.</p>
<p>Start the day early and with intention. It makes me feel much better.</p>
<h2 id="thought-bits">Thought bits</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do an <a href="https://jamesclear.com/2016-integrity-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">integrity report</a> ever since I read <a href="https://astobbe.me/books/atomic-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Atomic habits</a> and plan to do it (at least by the end of this year 😉).
The core questions are:</p>

<li>What are the core values that drive my life and work?</li>
<li>How am I living and working with integrity right now?</li>

<p>Lastly, I want to thank Jen Vermet, who reminded me to do this (yeah, it&rsquo;s almost August already) through her <a href="https://learnitalletter.substack.com/p/-letter-119-my-semi-annual-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">review letter</a>. I highly recommend her newsletter. Her letters are very introspective, personal and a great inspiration for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited for what&rsquo;s to come in the 5 remaining months and you can expect my annual review at the end of the year!
I want to finish off with a nice quote from an email signature that Michael Pollan read many years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope whatever you are doing , you stop once in awhile and not doing it at all

Now that I&rsquo;m leaving the city, I want to look back on the past months.</p>
<p>Living in Spain was a dream come true. Since I was little, I felt attracted to the country: the people, the language and the weather.
Barcelona was an obvious choice after falling in love with the city and making a good friend there in 2018.
I wanted to take these months for exploration and self discovery. I paused my work contract to find time for side projects and to go out.</p>
<h2 id="living-with-roomies">Living with roomies</h2>
<p>I moved in a shared flat with my friend which was also my first true roomie experience. After living alone for more than a year, I got to enjoy the solitude, but  it was interesting to live in a more lively environment. Living under the same roof with someone provides a deep view into how they live and deal with all kinds of daily situations.
As a result, I adopted some of their behaviors - some intentionally, some unconsciously.
Two of my roommates are a couple and I liked how openly they would discuss their worries and feelings.
I come from a family where we did not share much personal feelings, so I tend to choke them up, but my roomie told me how good it feels to vent off and not let problems accumulate.
There is a healthy limit of course, but I agree and have been opening up on my inner thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="eating-vegan">Eating vegan</h2>
<p>Secondly, I got into veganism through my roommates. They are good and healthy cooks and I liked to explore new meals. I started eating more vegetables (steamed 👌) and got new food inspirations. I realized how I could mostly drop all of the non-vegan stuff and find good substitutes. I already mostly avoided meat before (for health and ethical reasons) but consumed lots of dairies, eggs etc.
My friend raised my awareness for how I equally support industrial livestock farming with those animal products, just like meat.
I did not become vegan, but I&rsquo;ve set it as my baseline.</p>
<h2 id="side-projects">Side projects</h2>
<p>Working on my own projects was challenging and highly rewarding at the same time. It&rsquo;s challenging because there is no one to keep you responsible and motivated. On the other hand, finishing a project pushes the confidence in one&rsquo;s own skills and seeing people star the project, because they might potentially find it useful, feels great. My biggest project was my personal search engine <a href="https://github.com/elchead/misou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">misou</a>. It started as a Hackathon project with some friends from uni and I continued working on it to practice and make it usable.
On the side, I was reading O&rsquo;reilly literature on TDD, polished up on Typescript and React and enjoyed how I could bring into practice in my project without excuses (dirty legacy code..). With a classmate, I solved a <a href="https://github.com/elchead/mars-kata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">small kata</a> to practice TDD and get to know Svelte. It was really fun but also instructive to see the others perspective.
I also developed a little <a href="https://github.com/elchead/blog-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">blog CLI</a> which is super useful to me and forked a personal CRM to my needs.</p>
<p>Reserving time for my learning goals and work on what seems meaningful to me is something I definitely plan to keep.</p>
<h2 id="swimming-and-salsa">Swimming and Salsa</h2>
<p>I found much more time to exercise and rediscovered swimming. I like how swimming calms the mind and brings the focus to the body. Compared to other sports, I find it easier to do deliberate practice: focusing on breathing, body movements. And observing the improvement always felt rewarding. I went from panting after about 50m to calmly swimming freestyle for more than 1km.</p>
<p>I also went outside to dance much more often. I took my first bachata course and went on a salsa congress. I made progress in my style, but I realized that I need a regular dancing partner to practice outside classes. Consolidating new figuras in memory takes more than one class, but unless I feel good about them I won&rsquo;t incorporate them into social dance. As a salsa master told me on one occasion: &ldquo;It takes a lot of practice and going through the basics gets repetitive and boring, but this is what it takes to get good.&rdquo; I want to keep Salsa as a fun activity and don&rsquo;t become professional, but I will need more deliberate practice to progress.</p>
<h2 id="heading">☀️🏝😀</h2>
<p>The sunny weather and secondly the beach were real boosters for my happiness that I don&rsquo;t want to miss anymore. Sometimes I would pause and just appreciate how good it is to be here in this moment compared to the grey winter in Germany. The sun is my simple pleasure. Similarly, I also love the sea. I particularly enjoyed yoga classes on the beach in the morning, watching the sunrise, the outdoor beach gym and cold bathing.
But even a simple walk by the sea would lift my mood.
I&rsquo;ve set both elements high on the priority list for where I want to live after my studies.</p>
<h2 id="the-more-social-me">The more social me</h2>
<p>Since living alone during COVID times, I spent much less time socializing but also enjoyed spending time with myself. The experience with my roommates and the more social nature of the people here (talking and hanging out..), however got me to rethink.
I want to share more with my friends again and seek more time to hang out together. I&rsquo;ve changed my attitude towards strangers and enjoy talking to new people. In the last weeks that I approached people, I was impressed by the positive responses and amazed by the kind of people I coincidentally met.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The time passed all too fast and I am hesitant to leave. But what lies ahead is the next chapter enriched by all the learnings from the last one. Sure, I won&rsquo;t have another Erasmus semester but adventures are not a matter of chance or destiny, but rather something that needs to be looked for. I&rsquo;m excited to see what the next chapter will be!</p>
