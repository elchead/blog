I felt the same struggle, until I found a nice workflow in my notetaking app Obsidian that I want to share with you.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-journaling">The value of Journaling</h2>
<p>I believe that people fail to journal regularly because it&rsquo;s never urgent. So it recedes from the urgent but not necessarily important tasks. Yet it&rsquo;s those that would probably most benefit from it. Journaling is about escaping the rush of day-to-day, reflecting on what is happening, and finding intention for the day. But it&rsquo;s not just beneficial for ourselves. By rewinding the small beautiful moments, we can also become more appreciative of our dearest and loved ones.</p>
<p>Journaling can take different forms, be it asking yourself a couple of simple questions or long streamlining of thoughts (brain dump). But to start a habit it&rsquo;s best to keep it simple. Honestly, it even took me some time to get valuable answers to simple questions like &ldquo;What are you grateful for?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What would make today great?&rdquo;. I was just not used to asking this.</p>
<p>Yet, I believe it&rsquo;s very meaningful because it sets your intention for the day. We can become more appreciative about what we have, but maybe more importantly it can mentally prepare us for misfortune. Stoics call this negative visualization (also see <a href="/books/stoic-joy" rel="">my book notes</a>).</p>
<h2 id="journaling-with-obsidian">Journaling with Obsidian</h2>
<p>When deciding to start journaling you have to decide on a medium. Some prefer paper, but I love the keyboard and the benefits of digital notes. I initially used Notion which is great functionality-wise, but I disliked the sluggishness. It&rsquo;s great that it also works on mobile, but the slowness just made for a bad user experience. Finally, I switched to Obsidian, because it&rsquo;s my general long-term note-taking app. The fewer tools, the better. Also, the notes are stored in markdown files locally, which also gives you more control over your data.</p>
<p>Besides, the community has built some awesome plugins!
The built-in daily note plugin already provides the most important functionality: a button to create a timestamped title with your template.</p>
<h3 id="smart-templating-with-the-calendar-plugin">Smart templating with the Calendar plugin</h3>
<p>Later, I discovered the calendar plugin, which shows a nice calendar overview to open and create notes. But more crucially, it provides some templating features like linking notes with a tag like <code>[[{{yesterday}}]]</code> and referencing specific content like this <code>=[[{{yesterday}}]].want-to-improve</code>.
I find this convenient to quickly see my intentions from the day before.
The plugin can be easily installed inside Obsidian options under <code>Community plugins</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tabular-journal-view-with-the-dataview-plugin">Tabular journal view with the Dataview plugin</h3>
<p>One thing I liked in Notion was the tabular view of my journal. This allowed me to see the entries for each prompt at a glance. Luckily, there is the Dataview plugin that does exactly that! I enjoyed <a href="https://input.sh/replicating-notions-tables-with-obsidian-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> article to implement it, but you can also just <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">install it</a> and take my code snippet :)</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">table Weekday, Week as &#34;Week&#34;, row[&#34;Storyworthy&#34;] as &#34;Storyworthy&#34;,row[&#34;Day Rating&#34;] as &#34;Rating&#34;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">from &#34;Journal&#34; where !contains(file.name, &#34;1_DailyNotes&#34;) sort file.day desc
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><figure><a target="_blank" href="dataview.png" title="dataview.png" >
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">The tabular view, of course without my data üòâ</figcaption>
    </figure>
<h2 id="my-journaling-flow">My journaling flow</h2>
<p>You can find my whole note template here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_G8ZHs38CRmg9Sq-BoR1oM1y4xO9M0jc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">daily_template.md</a>, which is mostly taken from <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/daily-and-weekly-reviews-dataview/17021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.
The template pretty much speaks for itself. My morning journaling is fairly short. The visualization is maybe not so clear and also not heavily used by myself. I use it to write down my desired flow of the day and mention expected challenges.</p>
<p>In the evening, I take much more time to reflect on my actions. I start by first enumerating the most important happenings of the day under <code>Activities üë®‚ÄçüíªüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</code>.
I found that sometimes even crucial events get lost if I don&rsquo;t chronologically repass the day. Oh yes, my poor memory&hellip;
From this list, I find it easy to extract my learnings and positive and negative behaviors.
Recently, I&rsquo;m also trying to be more mindful about my eating habits, which is why I also have a rating for my diet.</p>
<p>Finally, I try to extract one story-worthy moment (inspired by <a href="/books/storyworthy" rel="">this</a> book). The idea is to be more aware of the mundane but beautiful moments. It&rsquo;s not the spectacular travel adventures that make for the best stories, but rather relatable moments. Moments that touch us emotionally, but that are difficult to see because we tend to look for the big and grandiose.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I finally found a workflow to make journaling stick. It&rsquo;s snappy and nicely integrates into my note-taking app with all the features I like (btw, Obsidian even has a vim plugin ü§ì and is available on mobile). I can directly link to my journal entries and easily integrate them into my personal search engine because it&rsquo;s just plain files.</p>
<p>One final thought before you leave. For me, it made a remarkable difference to love the tool I am using. Honestly, featurewise not a lot has changed since I switched to Obsidian. But the few upper points just made it feel much more personal. So, find what you like. Lower the barrier to start writing. It all get&rsquo;s easier once you did it for a few weeks consistently.</p>
<p>I am curious to learn about your journaling flow and am happy to answer any questions!</p>

Organization and structure are crucial for this system to work, even more than content collection. I can tell from past experience of dead archives that I had long forgotten about their existence. But even worse, file corpses can make it harder to find what we want. In order to overcome this problem, I experimented with a file structure system called PARA, invented by Tiago Forte.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-para">What is PARA</h2>
<p>The approach is inspired by the GTD methodology and its central idea is to organize files dynamically into one of 4 categories - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Dynamic means, that current projects are stored in a quickly accessible <code>Project</code> folder and are archived once finished. This sounds trivial, but most people organize files like in a library. A job application draft is hence likely to end up in a file hierarchy like <code>User/Uni/Applications/Interns/Company/...</code>.  But given that moving files on a computer is not as tedious, as moving books in a library and that projects have personal context, the dynamic approach in GTD has some benefits. The application document is not just a file with information (like the book), but it is a project that has a deadline and needs many sub-actions (research position and company, write motivation letter, update CV&hellip;). It is hence handy to have a central overview of all projects and respective material in a dedicated folder. And in that project folder I only want all the files that are relevant, and not have it mixed among other old applications and unrelated reference material. The latter might still be useful, but it probably just obscures your path to the important documents for the project. This is why PARA distinguishes between actionable items (Projects) and reference material (Resources) at the highest folder level.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the benefits of PARA, I recommend the <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">blog posts</a> from the creator.</p>
<p>In the following, I want to share what worked for me after about 8 months of usage. Many people struggle to distinguish the categories and are unsure where to place their files. This also happened to me and I hope that this post can help to clarify it a bit. The author recommends using the system cross-platform for consistency, but I must admit that the structure only made sense to me in the cloud drive and my <a href="../notion" rel="">Notion planner</a>. Not all categories persisted, but those that did, proved valuable.</p>
<h2 id="my-para-usage">My PARA usage</h2>
<h3 id="1-projects">1. Projects:</h3>
<p>Files that are part of a project (in the GTD sense). I have been mostly using it for gathering application material, bureaucracy documents, and as a place to drop files that I want to have quick access to on all my devices. I am not using it as much, since my amount of file-rich projects is mostly limited to uni and work at the moment. Also, I find it faster to store small things on my desktop and download folder, which I clean up during my weekly review. I intentionally use 01_Projects only when I want to benefit from cloud backups and version control.</p>
<p>In Notion, I abandoned the folder completely, because I prefer keeping a complete overview of my projects in my GTD-Planner called <a href="https://ticktick.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">TickTick</a> and maintaining them in both was too much overhead.</p>
<h3 id="2-areas">2. Areas:</h3>
<p>This is the folder I use frequently on my drive. At the moment it doesn&rsquo;t capture all of my life areas, but rather focus on document heavy areas such as (Career, Finance, Insurances, Uni). It mostly consists of official documents or information sheets. I realized that most of my areas don&rsquo;t have a lot of associated files and I prefer to have an overview of them and add information in Notion.</p>
<p>In Notion, I have a complete overview of my life-areas, including those that I don&rsquo;t document at all - like Family or Exercise. I do that to quickly oversee everything that asks for my attention and to evaluate their status quo in my reviews.</p>
<h3 id="3-resources">3. Resources:</h3>
<style>
  #callout {
    background: #22272e;
     

    padding: 1.5em 1.25em;
    border-radius: 3px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
  #callout-inner {
    margin-left: 1em;
  }
  @media (max-width: 767px) {
    #callout {
      padding: 1.5em 0.75em 1.5em 0.6em;
    }
    #callout-inner {
      margin-left: 0.5em;
    }
  }
</style>

<div id="callout">
  <div>üí°</div>
  <div id="callout-inner">Update: I now use it for quick access to check-soon resources. Soon means that I plan to read them in the next 3-4 weeks. It extends the purpose of my Read-Later app (articles and videos), to PDFs and websites mostly.</div>
</div>

<p>Resources is intended as a place to store information that I don&rsquo;t need now. I use it to store PDFs and presentations that I might want to refer to later. This can be travel inspirations, a programming book or a presentation I liked a lot and might want to share later. I try to group the material into topics, but they are generally more fine-grained than life areas. But it still happens that there also exists a folder such as Finance and this is where many people (including me) get confused in the beginning.</p>
<p>Should I place my file into Areas or Resources?  Or even more important, where did I put it?</p>
<p>For me, I distinguish them according to importance. My Areas include important file that I really need (mostly because they are official documents). My resources include reference material, which wouldn&rsquo;t be a catastrophe if I&rsquo;d somehow lose it.</p>
<p>In this sense it is really just an add-on for me which allows me to access non-essential files later, without cluttering up my other directories. Because it is not essential, I realized that I also tend to forget about what is inside, which makes it a bit futile right? I believe that the best way to make good use of the resources is to review and potentially clean them monthly.
But as always, only keep what serves you. If you don&rsquo;t find much value from this category, then it&rsquo;s maybe not worth the maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="4-archive">4. Archive:</h3>
<p>This is where I put old work and documents that aren&rsquo;t relevant anymore, but that I still want to keep. It includes the reports from my time in China, old learning resources and outdated documents that still need to be preserved. It is also where I put finished project folders.</p>
<h2 id="structure-evolves-naturally-over-time">Structure evolves naturally over time</h2>
<p>My main takeaway is that it takes time to get used to this structure and that you shouldn&rsquo;t overthink it too much. I think it is enough to have a rough understanding of how the categories differ and that the hierarchy is structured by usage. It is somehow like packing a rucksack - what is frequently needed is placed at the top.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s normal to be confused about the difference between Areas and Resources in the beginning, but I hope that my distinction helped to find your definitions.</p>
<p>Please reach out to me, when something is still unclear or if you want to share how PARA works for you :)</p>

Many people see it as an alternative to Evernote, but for me, it felt much more powerful than a note-taking app. I immediately fell in love with its simplistic markdown approach, which easily yields attractive pages. I always had difficulties keeping notes that I would like to check again, which discouraged me from using them extensively. Notion completely changed my attitude toward note-taking and writing because it made it fun - Yes, it indirectly made me write this blog!</p>
<p>I was quite hyped when I first saw how people used it as a <strong>life hub</strong> to have all information and planning in one place. I&rsquo;ve heard several people say that Notion has shaped their thinking because of how information is naturally stored in this system. And I couldn&rsquo;t agree less! I started to appreciate structure, writing down thoughts, and it sparked so many new ideas of how I could improve.</p>
<p>But enough praising; let me show you how it serves me and could potentially for you?</p>
<h1 id="what-i-use-notion-for">What I use Notion for</h1>
<h2 id="para">PARA</h2>
<p><a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PARA</a> is a <strong>hierarchical file system</strong> introduced by Tiago Forte to categorize information.
It consists of four categories and distinguishes information according to its <strong>actionability</strong> instead of topics. This is motivated by the <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> principle and worth another post. I won&rsquo;t explain it here, but there are a lot of good resources if you are interested. I find it most useful to keep track of my responsibilities and goals. It helps me see where I am and what I should prioritize right now. For this, I mainly use the first two categories in Notion, but all four are:</p>
<p><strong>Projects:</strong></p>
<p>Here I place all my current projects, which are not necessarily as big as they commonly sound. It might be a new tool I&rsquo;d like to try out, a book I want to read, or finding a birthday present.</p>
<p><strong>Areas:</strong></p>
<p>Here I list all areas which I want or need to keep track of. I like to revisit them regularly as part of my weekly review to check if any of them deserves some more attention or action. For me they include: career, health, my website, Chinese, finance&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty empty for me because of other outsourcing tools, but I intend to use it mostly for notes, documents, and articles that are not relevant right now bight might be later.</p>
<p><strong>Archive:</strong></p>
<p>As the name implies, it&rsquo;s where completed projects, and no longer maintained areas, etc., go.</p>
<!-- I also use the same hierarchy on my computer and for my bookmarks. Accordingly, my activity in each category varies across platforms. For Notion, it's mainly the first two in my case. -->
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p>How do I want to spend my time and energy? For answering this big question, I use the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-one-touch-guide-to-doing-a-weekly-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Weekly Review</a> (post will follow)</li>
<li>Quarterly Goals</li>
<li>Wanna do list: dump for things I&rsquo;d like to do someday</li>
<li>Skill wish list</li>
<li>My current weak points</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>I mainly document the following right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortcuts cheat sheet</li>
<li>Engineering wiki: setup readmes, tricks, resources</li>
<li>Media list (books, podcasts, videos)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="work--uni">Work / Uni</h2>
<ul>
<li>Task planning and meeting notes</li>
<li>Course information and planning</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal-crm">Personal CRM</h2>
<p>The motivation of keeping track of my friends is to be more considerate about those I most care about. I&rsquo;d like to remember more details about their likings and preferences. What is her favorite wine, or what was the name of the book he was so enthusiastic about? By writing it down, I try to compensate for my faulty memory, especially for people that I don&rsquo;t see regularly. It might seem weird or unnatural, but I think that it&rsquo;s actually one form of how I appreciate my friends because I obviously don&rsquo;t do this for everyone :)</p>
<h2 id="gift-planner">Gift planner</h2>
<p>Going along with the prior motivation, I also found that <strong>capturing ideas in time</strong> for a good present handy. In the past, thinking of big occasions always gave me headaches to suddenly come up with a good idea. But as often, thinking a step ahead can make things much easier later.
Right now, Christmas is around, and I never had more ideas on what to gift!</p>
<h2 id="my-city">My city</h2>
<p>Munich is my new home, and here I save activities I&rsquo;d like to do and archive the completed ones. It might also become neat when friends come to visit :)</p>
<h1 id="what-i-dont-use-it-for">What I don&rsquo;t use it for</h1>
<p>Notion is great for many things, but one of the biggest shortcomings for me is the <strong>lack of an offline mode</strong>. This makes the app less responsive and slower, so that I prefer other apps for some areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task planning (My choice: TickTick)</li>
<li>Quick note-taking (My choice: Google Keep)</li>
<li>Archive for internet resources (My choices: Instapaper, Browser bookmarks)</li>
<li>Long term (knowledge or personal) notes: (My choice: Obsidian)</li>
</ul>
<!-- knowledge storage.. Notion is based on page idea. But the brain and ideas are interconnected.. New tools such as Roam Research and Obsidian. I'm currently building my knowledge net in Obsidian, and I want to show it to you later when it has grown more.-->
<h1 id="the-choice-is-yours">The choice is yours</h1>
<p>If you find any of my use cases appealing but are not yet convinced of trying yet another software, I can totally understand that. Of course, there exist many other options. I&rsquo;ve recently seen a <a href="https://forge.medium.com/how-google-drive-can-make-every-corner-of-your-life-easier-9f3cc1acbb68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">series</a> on Medium about how to use Google Drive as a life hub. Evernote is a classic option but there also new interesting apps like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Roam Research</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Obsidian</a>. To help you make a choice, I want to point out my strong points for Notion briefly.</p>
<h2 id="notions-strong-points">Notions Strong Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is free!
For personal use, you practically don&rsquo;t have to pay to enjoy the full Notion experience. Unlike other apps, the premium option unlocks perks but no crucial features. (unlimited file uploads, version history, access to the Content API). And <strong>students</strong> even get the upgrade for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration feature</p>
<p>Yes, working collaboratively on documents is no different from Google Docs, but it is still nice to organize projects and ideas in the lean Notion style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Databases</p>
<p>One feature I started to appreciate a lot after some time is databases. When you create a new page, you can decide between a table, kanban board, calendar, etc. But they are all essentially databases which just differ in their visualization. So if you later find that your initial table might be much better represented as a nice gallery, that is possible with a click. What I especially appreciate about them is their relations. I like how information is connected in this way without cluttering it up. This makes it possible to link your meeting notes separate from the project or link your book list to the person who recommended it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown+</p>
<p>I like Markdown&rsquo;s focus on content with minimalistic styling elements. Also, it supports the integration of math equations, code snippets, etc. Additionally, Notion offers a few extra features for styling (e.g., toggle lists and callouts, date referencing&hellip;). Also, it supports many embeds to integrate youtube videos, files, web widgets&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>If you are excited to try it out now, here are some final links to quickly get started with some awesome <a href="https://www.notion.so/Notion-Template-Gallery-181e961aeb5c4ee6915307c0dfd5156d666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">templates</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I really liked the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67jFfjwUvRQ&amp;ab_channel=UnJadedJade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">video</a> from <em>UnJaded Jade</em> on her setup because she clearly shared the same hype as I did and had some interesting use case ideas.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank Ali Abdal for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONG26-2mIHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">youtube video</a>, which is how my Notion journey began.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and let me know if you found any of this useful or have some question!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
