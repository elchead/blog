I felt the same struggle, until I found a nice workflow in my notetaking app Obsidian that I want to share with you.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-journaling">The value of Journaling</h2>
<p>I believe that people fail to journal regularly because it&rsquo;s never urgent. So it recedes from the urgent but not necessarily important tasks. Yet it&rsquo;s those that would probably most benefit from it. Journaling is about escaping the rush of day-to-day, reflecting on what is happening, and finding intention for the day. But it&rsquo;s not just beneficial for ourselves. By rewinding the small beautiful moments, we can also become more appreciative of our dearest and loved ones.</p>
<p>Journaling can take different forms, be it asking yourself a couple of simple questions or long streamlining of thoughts (brain dump). But to start a habit it&rsquo;s best to keep it simple. Honestly, it even took me some time to get valuable answers to simple questions like &ldquo;What are you grateful for?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What would make today great?&rdquo;. I was just not used to asking this.</p>
<p>Yet, I believe it&rsquo;s very meaningful because it sets your intention for the day. We can become more appreciative about what we have, but maybe more importantly it can mentally prepare us for misfortune. Stoics call this negative visualization (also see <a href="/books/stoic-joy" rel="">my book notes</a>).</p>
<h2 id="journaling-with-obsidian">Journaling with Obsidian</h2>
<p>When deciding to start journaling you have to decide on a medium. Some prefer paper, but I love the keyboard and the benefits of digital notes. I initially used Notion which is great functionality-wise, but I disliked the sluggishness. It&rsquo;s great that it also works on mobile, but the slowness just made for a bad user experience. Finally, I switched to Obsidian, because it&rsquo;s my general long-term note-taking app. The fewer tools, the better. Also, the notes are stored in markdown files locally, which also gives you more control over your data.</p>
<p>Besides, the community has built some awesome plugins!
The built-in daily note plugin already provides the most important functionality: a button to create a timestamped title with your template.</p>
<h3 id="smart-templating-with-the-calendar-plugin">Smart templating with the Calendar plugin</h3>
<p>Later, I discovered the calendar plugin, which shows a nice calendar overview to open and create notes. But more crucially, it provides some templating features like linking notes with a tag like <code>[[{{yesterday}}]]</code> and referencing specific content like this <code>=[[{{yesterday}}]].want-to-improve</code>.
I find this convenient to quickly see my intentions from the day before.
The plugin can be easily installed inside Obsidian options under <code>Community plugins</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tabular-journal-view-with-the-dataview-plugin">Tabular journal view with the Dataview plugin</h3>
<p>One thing I liked in Notion was the tabular view of my journal. This allowed me to see the entries for each prompt at a glance. Luckily, there is the Dataview plugin that does exactly that! I enjoyed <a href="https://input.sh/replicating-notions-tables-with-obsidian-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> article to implement it, but you can also just <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">install it</a> and take my code snippet :)</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">from &#34;Journal&#34; where !contains(file.name, &#34;1_DailyNotes&#34;) sort file.day desc

    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">The tabular view, of course without my data üòâ</figcaption>
    </figure>
<h2 id="my-journaling-flow">My journaling flow</h2>
<p>You can find my whole note template here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_G8ZHs38CRmg9Sq-BoR1oM1y4xO9M0jc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">daily_template.md</a>, which is mostly taken from <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/daily-and-weekly-reviews-dataview/17021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.
The template pretty much speaks for itself. My morning journaling is fairly short. The visualization is maybe not so clear and also not heavily used by myself. I use it to write down my desired flow of the day and mention expected challenges.</p>
<p>In the evening, I take much more time to reflect on my actions. I start by first enumerating the most important happenings of the day under <code>Activities üë®‚ÄçüíªüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</code>.
I found that sometimes even crucial events get lost if I don&rsquo;t chronologically repass the day. Oh yes, my poor memory&hellip;
From this list, I find it easy to extract my learnings and positive and negative behaviors.
Recently, I&rsquo;m also trying to be more mindful about my eating habits, which is why I also have a rating for my diet.</p>
<p>Finally, I try to extract one story-worthy moment (inspired by <a href="/books/storyworthy" rel="">this</a> book). The idea is to be more aware of the mundane but beautiful moments. It&rsquo;s not the spectacular travel adventures that make for the best stories, but rather relatable moments. Moments that touch us emotionally, but that are difficult to see because we tend to look for the big and grandiose.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I finally found a workflow to make journaling stick. It&rsquo;s snappy and nicely integrates into my note-taking app with all the features I like (btw, Obsidian even has a vim plugin ü§ì and is available on mobile). I can directly link to my journal entries and easily integrate them into my personal search engine because it&rsquo;s just plain files.</p>
<p>One final thought before you leave. For me, it made a remarkable difference to love the tool I am using. Honestly, featurewise not a lot has changed since I switched to Obsidian. But the few upper points just made it feel much more personal. So, find what you like. Lower the barrier to start writing. It all get&rsquo;s easier once you did it for a few weeks consistently.</p>
<p>I am curious to learn about your journaling flow and am happy to answer any questions!</p>

Organization and structure are crucial for this system to work, even more than content collection. I can tell from past experience of dead archives that I had long forgotten about their existence. But even worse, file corpses can make it harder to find what we want. In order to overcome this problem, I experimented with a file structure system called PARA, invented by Tiago Forte.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-para">What is PARA</h2>
<p>The approach is inspired by the GTD methodology and its central idea is to organize files dynamically into one of 4 categories - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Dynamic means, that current projects are stored in a quickly accessible <code>Project</code> folder and are archived once finished. This sounds trivial, but most people organize files like in a library. A job application draft is hence likely to end up in a file hierarchy like <code>User/Uni/Applications/Interns/Company/...</code>.  But given that moving files on a computer is not as tedious, as moving books in a library and that projects have personal context, the dynamic approach in GTD has some benefits. The application document is not just a file with information (like the book), but it is a project that has a deadline and needs many sub-actions (research position and company, write motivation letter, update CV&hellip;). It is hence handy to have a central overview of all projects and respective material in a dedicated folder. And in that project folder I only want all the files that are relevant, and not have it mixed among other old applications and unrelated reference material. The latter might still be useful, but it probably just obscures your path to the important documents for the project. This is why PARA distinguishes between actionable items (Projects) and reference material (Resources) at the highest folder level.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the benefits of PARA, I recommend the <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">blog posts</a> from the creator.</p>
<p>In the following, I want to share what worked for me after about 8 months of usage. Many people struggle to distinguish the categories and are unsure where to place their files. This also happened to me and I hope that this post can help to clarify it a bit. The author recommends using the system cross-platform for consistency, but I must admit that the structure only made sense to me in the cloud drive and my <a href="../notion" rel="">Notion planner</a>. Not all categories persisted, but those that did, proved valuable.</p>
<h2 id="my-para-usage">My PARA usage</h2>
<h3 id="1-projects">1. Projects:</h3>
<p>Files that are part of a project (in the GTD sense). I have been mostly using it for gathering application material, bureaucracy documents, and as a place to drop files that I want to have quick access to on all my devices. I am not using it as much, since my amount of file-rich projects is mostly limited to uni and work at the moment. Also, I find it faster to store small things on my desktop and download folder, which I clean up during my weekly review. I intentionally use 01_Projects only when I want to benefit from cloud backups and version control.</p>
<p>In Notion, I abandoned the folder completely, because I prefer keeping a complete overview of my projects in my GTD-Planner called <a href="https://ticktick.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">TickTick</a> and maintaining them in both was too much overhead.</p>
<h3 id="2-areas">2. Areas:</h3>
<p>This is the folder I use frequently on my drive. At the moment it doesn&rsquo;t capture all of my life areas, but rather focus on document heavy areas such as (Career, Finance, Insurances, Uni). It mostly consists of official documents or information sheets. I realized that most of my areas don&rsquo;t have a lot of associated files and I prefer to have an overview of them and add information in Notion.</p>
<p>In Notion, I have a complete overview of my life-areas, including those that I don&rsquo;t document at all - like Family or Exercise. I do that to quickly oversee everything that asks for my attention and to evaluate their status quo in my reviews.</p>
<h3 id="3-resources">3. Resources:</h3>
<style>
  #callout {
    background: #22272e;
     

    padding: 1.5em 1.25em;
    border-radius: 3px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
  #callout-inner {
    margin-left: 1em;
  }
  @media (max-width: 767px) {
    #callout {
      padding: 1.5em 0.75em 1.5em 0.6em;
    }
    #callout-inner {
      margin-left: 0.5em;
    }
  }
</style>

<div id="callout">
  <div>üí°</div>
  <div id="callout-inner">Update: I now use it for quick access to check-soon resources. Soon means that I plan to read them in the next 3-4 weeks. It extends the purpose of my Read-Later app (articles and videos), to PDFs and websites mostly.</div>
</div>

<p>Resources is intended as a place to store information that I don&rsquo;t need now. I use it to store PDFs and presentations that I might want to refer to later. This can be travel inspirations, a programming book or a presentation I liked a lot and might want to share later. I try to group the material into topics, but they are generally more fine-grained than life areas. But it still happens that there also exists a folder such as Finance and this is where many people (including me) get confused in the beginning.</p>
<p>Should I place my file into Areas or Resources?  Or even more important, where did I put it?</p>
<p>For me, I distinguish them according to importance. My Areas include important file that I really need (mostly because they are official documents). My resources include reference material, which wouldn&rsquo;t be a catastrophe if I&rsquo;d somehow lose it.</p>
<p>In this sense it is really just an add-on for me which allows me to access non-essential files later, without cluttering up my other directories. Because it is not essential, I realized that I also tend to forget about what is inside, which makes it a bit futile right? I believe that the best way to make good use of the resources is to review and potentially clean them monthly.
But as always, only keep what serves you. If you don&rsquo;t find much value from this category, then it&rsquo;s maybe not worth the maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="4-archive">4. Archive:</h3>
<p>This is where I put old work and documents that aren&rsquo;t relevant anymore, but that I still want to keep. It includes the reports from my time in China, old learning resources and outdated documents that still need to be preserved. It is also where I put finished project folders.</p>
<h2 id="structure-evolves-naturally-over-time">Structure evolves naturally over time</h2>
<p>My main takeaway is that it takes time to get used to this structure and that you shouldn&rsquo;t overthink it too much. I think it is enough to have a rough understanding of how the categories differ and that the hierarchy is structured by usage. It is somehow like packing a rucksack - what is frequently needed is placed at the top.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s normal to be confused about the difference between Areas and Resources in the beginning, but I hope that my distinction helped to find your definitions.</p>
<p>Please reach out to me, when something is still unclear or if you want to share how PARA works for you :)</p>

<p>How do you consume media? - It sounds like a silly question, but I think it&rsquo;s very much worth thinking about it. After all, we spend a considerable amount of time doing it. It might be to research something specific, to learn something new, or simply to entertain ourselves. The internet provides a rich resource of information, but it&rsquo;s probably also the most distracting source.</p>
<p>We might start the browser to check some specific information, but as we go, we find another article on the side that catches our attention. It sounds too interesting to dismiss! The article might link to an exciting video on youtube. Of course, we want to see it, and it only takes 2 minutes after all! But once you are on youtube, you probably all know how easy it is to get in an open-loop. Our initial search to look up information on having a pet might eventually end with kitten videos on youtube (and they can go even much further..). Yes, they are cute, but is it helpful to decide at this moment?</p>
<p>I know this example is very contrived and ridiculous, but surely most of us regularly get into these open loops.</p>
<p>And for me, this situation was also tricky. On the one hand, I didn&rsquo;t want to dismiss interesting articles, but I also felt conscience-stricken about getting distracted by content that is not relevant at this moment. Of course, there are easy ways around this. Some use bookmarks, and others like to keep 50+ tabs open in their browser (I was astounded when I saw this!). But I believe that save-for-later apps provide several benefits over classical bookmarks (and the tabs option, of course).</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-check-later-apps">The benefits of Check-Later apps</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid open loops</strong></p>
<p>I think that it needs an active effort to resist the temptation of checking an interesting but currently irrelevant article or video. In fact, platforms are designed to take us into this open-loop trap of consumption. That&rsquo;s good for their success, but do you want this? Having a dedicated place to store and the mindset of content collection helped me escape the open-loops more often. Also, I didn&rsquo;t particularly like cluttering my bookmarks, intended for quickly accessing frequently visited websites, with specific content I want to checkout (this list can grow quickly..). Now, I can read whenever I want to and also don&rsquo;t miss out on good content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easily find what you want</strong></p>
<p>I like to save my content in categories. The Check-Later app lets me choose a topic and get access to all the related resources. What makes this better than bookmarks is that you have a keyword search that checks all your articles&rsquo; content - very neat! Also, I can archive articles after having read them and still access them later through search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More selective content choices</strong></p>
<p>Whenever I see something that catches my attention now, I think twice if I really want to consume this. For once, it takes slightly more effort than just clicking on the link (so lazy, I know). Secondly, I know that it will have to compete with all the other appealing stuff on my list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge conservation</strong></p>
<p>Besides the benefit of quickly retrieving old content, it also provides the ability to store highlights of articles and attach notes. It is then possible to extract your highlights and notes and review them. I&rsquo;m forgetful of details, and statistics show that the majority does, so I like to be reminded of interesting ideas. Also, I like how these old ideas connect with others and expand. It makes me feel more convinced that what I&rsquo;m reading now is not just for the moment but part of something bigger that grows over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading experience</strong></p>
<p>In a read-later app, every article is displayed plainly as text, like a book, without all the distractions on websites. Also, when used on a mobile app, you can access them offline.</p>
   <figure>

  <figcaption>With Instapaper you have a good overview of your content and quickly find old articles and notes through search.</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Instapaper</a></p>
<p>This one is my favorite because of its clean and simplistic interface and the ability to attach notes to my highlights. Unfortunately, the free version is limited to five notes per month and doesn&rsquo;t support a full-text search for all articles. But the free version is good to try it out and enough for light usage. For developers, it also provides an Open API (I might try this in the future). Compared to its close competitor, Pocket, its premium version is also significantly cheaper ($29.99/year ~‚Ç¨23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pocket</a></p>
<p>Its basic principle is very similar to Instapaper but provides slightly more functionality (tags, text to speech..). The free version is limited to 3 highlights per article (which I find very restrictive) and doesn&rsquo;t include a full-text search. Its premium version is ‚Ç¨39.99/year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://raindrop.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Raindrop.io</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the closest option to the classical bookmark manager but is much more attractive and powerful. You can organize links in folders, attach tags, and it has a beautiful interface. The premium version also provides full-text search and full download of the websites, but it also has good free functionality. Be aware, however, that it doesn&rsquo;t support text highlighting nor note-taking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://readwise.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Readwise</a></p>
<p>This app is different and intended as an extension of a check-later app. It builds on the idea of knowledge conservation and lets you revisit your ebook &amp; article highlights. According to your preferences, it provides five selected highlights per day as part of spaced repetition. Simply put, it is the Anki version for what you read. You can also include gaps in the highlight or reformulate it as a question to trigger your memory. The premium version even supports export to Evernote &amp; Notion. You can connect it to a wide variety of services such as Instapaper and Pocket, but it also supports Twitter, Kindle, PDF import, Airr (currently iOS only, but great for highlighting in Podcasts), and many more. This app is, however, not free and distinguishes between a Lite version ($4.49 billed annually or $4.99 billed monthly) and the full version ($7.99 billed annually or $8.99 billed monthly). Students also enjoy a 50% discount.
I agree that this is quite some money for the basic functionality to review your highlights, and I still have to figure out if it&rsquo;s worth the price for me.</p>
<p>However, it provides a free month trial for everyone, and the invitation system puts an extra free month on top. So I think it&rsquo;s worth giving it a shot. If you want to try it out, you are welcome to use <a href="https://readwise.io/i/adrian136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my referral link</a>, which grants both of us an extra free month. It would also be interesting for me to hear your opinion on it!
It could also be interesting to develop such a service (for import in Anki maybe?). The Instapaper API and an <a href="https://medium.com/@sawyerh/how-i-export-process-and-resurface-my-kindle-highlights-addc9de9af1a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">article</a> on how to export Kindle highlights inspired me to maybe try it out in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I find this system very helpful to be more aware and selective about what I consume, and I enjoy the distraction-free reading experience with the ability to attach my thoughts to it. Previously, I had a hard time locating once read articles, so I find the full-text search very powerful. While the free app versions are limited to light usage, I feel that the provided value is very much worth the few Euros per month. But as always, the best way to find out if it is for you is by trying out yourself.
I&rsquo;d be happy to hear about your experience!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Notion - A powerful documenting tool for Notes, Projects, Wiki...</title><link>https://astobbe.me/posts/notion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://astobbe.me/posts/notion/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Today, I feel excited to share the tool that has most influenced my exploration of a more organized me. Many people see it as an alternative to Evernote, but for me, it felt much more powerful than a note-taking app. I immediately fell in love with its simplistic markdown approach, which easily yields attractive pages. I always had difficulties keeping notes that I would like to check again, which discouraged me from using them extensively. Notion completely changed my attitude toward note-taking and writing because it made it fun - Yes, it indirectly made me write this blog!</p>
<p>I was quite hyped when I first saw how people used it as a <strong>life hub</strong> to have all information and planning in one place. I&rsquo;ve heard several people say that Notion has shaped their thinking because of how information is naturally stored in this system. And I couldn&rsquo;t agree less! I started to appreciate structure, writing down thoughts, and it sparked so many new ideas of how I could improve.</p>
<p>But enough praising; let me show you how it serves me and could potentially for you?</p>
<h1 id="what-i-use-notion-for">What I use Notion for</h1>
<h2 id="para">PARA</h2>
<p><a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PARA</a> is a <strong>hierarchical file system</strong> introduced by Tiago Forte to categorize information.
It consists of four categories and distinguishes information according to its <strong>actionability</strong> instead of topics. This is motivated by the <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> principle and worth another post. I won&rsquo;t explain it here, but there are a lot of good resources if you are interested. I find it most useful to keep track of my responsibilities and goals. It helps me see where I am and what I should prioritize right now. For this, I mainly use the first two categories in Notion, but all four are:</p>
<p><strong>Projects:</strong></p>
<p>Here I place all my current projects, which are not necessarily as big as they commonly sound. It might be a new tool I&rsquo;d like to try out, a book I want to read, or finding a birthday present.</p>
<p><strong>Areas:</strong></p>
<p>Here I list all areas which I want or need to keep track of. I like to revisit them regularly as part of my weekly review to check if any of them deserves some more attention or action. For me they include: career, health, my website, Chinese, finance&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty empty for me because of other outsourcing tools, but I intend to use it mostly for notes, documents, and articles that are not relevant right now bight might be later.</p>
<p><strong>Archive:</strong></p>
<p>As the name implies, it&rsquo;s where completed projects, and no longer maintained areas, etc., go.</p>
<!-- I also use the same hierarchy on my computer and for my bookmarks. Accordingly, my activity in each category varies across platforms. For Notion, it's mainly the first two in my case. -->
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p>How do I want to spend my time and energy? For answering this big question, I use the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-one-touch-guide-to-doing-a-weekly-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Weekly Review</a> (post will follow)</li>
<li>Quarterly Goals</li>
<li>Wanna do list: dump for things I&rsquo;d like to do someday</li>
<li>Skill wish list</li>
<li>My current weak points</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>I mainly document the following right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortcuts cheat sheet</li>
<li>Engineering wiki: setup readmes, tricks, resources</li>
<li>Media list (books, podcasts, videos)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="work--uni">Work / Uni</h2>
<ul>
<li>Task planning and meeting notes</li>
<li>Course information and planning</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal-crm">Personal CRM</h2>
<p>The motivation of keeping track of my friends is to be more considerate about those I most care about. I&rsquo;d like to remember more details about their likings and preferences. What is her favorite wine, or what was the name of the book he was so enthusiastic about? By writing it down, I try to compensate for my faulty memory, especially for people that I don&rsquo;t see regularly. It might seem weird or unnatural, but I think that it&rsquo;s actually one form of how I appreciate my friends because I obviously don&rsquo;t do this for everyone :)</p>
<h2 id="gift-planner">Gift planner</h2>
<p>Going along with the prior motivation, I also found that <strong>capturing ideas in time</strong> for a good present handy. In the past, thinking of big occasions always gave me headaches to suddenly come up with a good idea. But as often, thinking a step ahead can make things much easier later.
Right now, Christmas is around, and I never had more ideas on what to gift!</p>
<h2 id="my-city">My city</h2>
<p>Munich is my new home, and here I save activities I&rsquo;d like to do and archive the completed ones. It might also become neat when friends come to visit :)</p>
<h1 id="what-i-dont-use-it-for">What I don&rsquo;t use it for</h1>
<p>Notion is great for many things, but one of the biggest shortcomings for me is the <strong>lack of an offline mode</strong>. This makes the app less responsive and slower, so that I prefer other apps for some areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task planning (My choice: TickTick)</li>

<!-- knowledge storage.. Notion is based on page idea. But the brain and ideas are interconnected.. New tools such as Roam Research and Obsidian. I'm currently building my knowledge net in Obsidian, and I want to show it to you later when it has grown more.-->
<h1 id="the-choice-is-yours">The choice is yours</h1>
<p>If you find any of my use cases appealing but are not yet convinced of trying yet another software, I can totally understand that. Of course, there exist many other options. I&rsquo;ve recently seen a <a href="https://forge.medium.com/how-google-drive-can-make-every-corner-of-your-life-easier-9f3cc1acbb68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">series</a> on Medium about how to use Google Drive as a life hub. Evernote is a classic option but there also new interesting apps like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Roam Research</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Obsidian</a>. To help you make a choice, I want to point out my strong points for Notion briefly.</p>
<h2 id="notions-strong-points">Notions Strong Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is free!
For personal use, you practically don&rsquo;t have to pay to enjoy the full Notion experience. Unlike other apps, the premium option unlocks perks but no crucial features. (unlimited file uploads, version history, access to the Content API). And <strong>students</strong> even get the upgrade for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration feature</p>
<p>Yes, working collaboratively on documents is no different from Google Docs, but it is still nice to organize projects and ideas in the lean Notion style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Databases</p>
<p>One feature I started to appreciate a lot after some time is databases. When you create a new page, you can decide between a table, kanban board, calendar, etc. But they are all essentially databases which just differ in their visualization. So if you later find that your initial table might be much better represented as a nice gallery, that is possible with a click. What I especially appreciate about them is their relations. I like how information is connected in this way without cluttering it up. This makes it possible to link your meeting notes separate from the project or link your book list to the person who recommended it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown+</p>
<p>I like Markdown&rsquo;s focus on content with minimalistic styling elements. Also, it supports the integration of math equations, code snippets, etc. Additionally, Notion offers a few extra features for styling (e.g., toggle lists and callouts, date referencing&hellip;). Also, it supports many embeds to integrate youtube videos, files, web widgets&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>If you are excited to try it out now, here are some final links to quickly get started with some awesome <a href="https://www.notion.so/Notion-Template-Gallery-181e961aeb5c4ee6915307c0dfd5156d666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">templates</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I really liked the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67jFfjwUvRQ&amp;ab_channel=UnJadedJade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">video</a> from <em>UnJaded Jade</em> on her setup because she clearly shared the same hype as I did and had some interesting use case ideas.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank Ali Abdal for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONG26-2mIHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">youtube video</a>, which is how my Notion journey began.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and let me know if you found any of this useful or have some question!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The Second Brain - My life-changing companion</title><link>https://astobbe.me/posts/2020-11-15-second-brain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://astobbe.me/posts/2020-11-15-second-brain/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is the beginning of a bigger series on which I want to introduce some ideas about my new life companion. For me, this concept was pivotal in how I want to live. It helped me become clearer on what I want and focus on my priorities. I use it to offload information to have more capacities for being present-focused. Finally, I became fully digital.</p>
<p>I struggled quite a bit on finding a proper word because it touches so many aspects. It is related to productivity, self-improvement, and knowledge management. In the end, I think that the term second brain, made famous by Tiago Forte, is maybe a good superordinate for what it tries to achieve. In fact, I was hugely inspired by him and adopted a lot of his ideas. He describes the second-brain as a knowledge management system. Once I got into this area, I discovered a lot of other content related to productivity and self-improvement. I took what seems useful to me, and I am still exploring.</p>
<h2 id="who-might-find-it-interesting">Who might find it interesting</h2>
<p>I think that the ideas especially speak to life-long learners, long-term thinkers, and those who actively seek to improve themselves. It is also helpful for those who would like to bring a bit more structure in their self-organization.</p>
<p>I fully acknowledge that it might not fit everyone, but if you are a bit excited by now, I think that you might find something useful. This post might feel a bit overwhelming by trying to give an encompassing vision, but I will split up the upcoming posts thematically.</p>
<p>When I started, I really just wanted to find a system to organize myself better. But I quickly started enjoying the process of tweaking my workflow and learning more about it. While it also helped me become more productive, the most meaningful benefit for me is what I found (and still find) out about myself during the journey.</p>
<p>If you are still with me, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own
&ndash; <cite>Bruce Lee</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-goals">The goals</h2>
<h3 id="time-is-too-short">Time is too short</h3>
<p>I think that many of us have the same problem as I had. We haven&rsquo;t got enough time! There are simply too many things we would like to do. As a consequence, we tend to overload ourselves trying to keep up with our thirsty curiosity. Life is a rush; while doing one thing, we are already thinking about what is upcoming. At some point, we might feel overwhelmed and stressed out. We hassle each day, and at the end of the day, we still might feel frustrated about not having achieved everything we aimed for.</p>
<p>Then I realized that time-management is solely about priorities. Time is limited, and it is more helpful to accept that than somehow trying to stretch it (which won&rsquo;t work üòâ).</p>
<p>Secondly, I gained another perspective on being busy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being busy means I&rsquo;m out of control
&ndash; <cite>Derek Sivers</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I constantly feel busy, it is probably time to reexamine my system and rules. That is not to say that I want to be lazier, but that I want to be more focused and thoughtful about my actions. As part of this system, I want to become more aware of my time management.</p>
<h3 id="getting-things-done">Getting things done</h3>
<p>This is the productivity part of the whole companion. We all know it from very vividly from New Year&rsquo;s resolutions: it&rsquo;s easy to make plans but it&rsquo;s hard to execute them. Often, we either don&rsquo;t find the time or feel paralyzed about how to get started.</p>
<p>In this problems pursuit, I adopted some habits to help me get my prioritized work done. I had been using a calendar and to-do-list before, but <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-one-touch-guide-to-doing-a-weekly-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Tiago Forte&rsquo;s Weekly Review</a> and ideas from <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">David Allen&rsquo;s GTD</a>¬†brought my organization to another level. They help me to get my priorities straight and truncate my work into actionable items. I will cover the techniques in later posts, so stay tuned!</p>
<h3 id="mental-focus-and-presence">Mental focus and presence</h3>
<p>While working out future plans and goals helps guide actions, this should ultimately serve to become more present. By storing thoughts and relevant information in a central place, you no longer need to worry about them. Who doesn&rsquo;t know it? It&rsquo;s so easy to get distracted during work, because different ideas and responsibilities pop up. Stopping this completely might seem unfeasible, but every written down item is one less to worry about.</p>
<p>This mental offloading of information also helps to calm my mind and be more present. I find this not only beneficial for focused working but also to be happier. And of course, people around you highly appreciate the presence of mind! It goes without saying that changing this behavior takes time and effort, but I think it is worthwhile to strive for.</p>
<h3 id="sustainable-knowledge-collection">Sustainable Knowledge collection</h3>
<p>This point tries to address two problems I realized. First, I was unhappy with how much I forget about the content I consume: be it books, articles, videos. As an enthusiastic language learner, I&rsquo;m highly convinced of spaced-repetition, so I thought that I could also more generally apply this technique. The first step for me was to make the content retrievable. From past experience, I found general notetaking on specific content not sustainable for long-term storage (I tended to never look it up again).</p>
<p>Moreover, I wanted to build up a reference system for interesting source to check later. Not everything we consume or find is relevant at the moment, but it would be valuable to be able to pick up the content once it is needed. At the same time, the system needs to be powerful enough to actually find the information you need; storing is not enough ;) For this, I found the PARA file hierarchy very helpful. Moreover, I extended my workflow with tools for processing all kinds of information: be it academic, documents, media content, thoughts. I also changed my way of how and what I consume.</p>
<h2 id="my-positive-side-effects">My positive side-effects</h2>
<p>During my journey on finding a system that works for me, I also found out a lot about myself. I realized how good writing is to process my thoughts. I don&rsquo;t fancy writing poetic texts, but I find it highly practical to communicate ideas concisely.</p>
<p>As I started to take notes, I also noticed how it precipitated an avalanche of new thoughts and ideas. On a <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-543-learn-the-system-for-getting-things-done/https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-543-learn-the-system-for-getting-things-done/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">podcast episode</a>, I also found that other people seem to experience the same. Maybe you find this neat too?</p>
<p>Finally, I became more self-reflective not only about my planning but also on how I do things. Again, I don&rsquo;t want to go into details, but you will find posts about this later if you are interested.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>I admit that all of this might sound a bit lofty. There are simply too many self-proclaimed productivity and self-improvement books, who promise to change your life (and I assertively object such claims!). Many ideas sound nice but remain abstract, don&rsquo;t get applied and are consequently forgotten.</p>
<p>I think that Derek Sivers put it very nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may hear something or see something that gives you a new idea. But it&rsquo;s only when you stop and think of your work through this new perspective, that you actually jump up and go turn the idea into reality. That&rsquo;s the real inspiration that everyone is looking for.
&ndash; <cite>Derek Sivers</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the upcoming posts, I want to give some practical insights on how I applied these techniques to my life. But to get something useful from it, you will have to apply it to your life!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
