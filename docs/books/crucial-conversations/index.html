üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences We can be honest and critical but also have a healthy dialogue, when approached correctly. To step out of heated feelings, we need to trace back the path of action (storytelling!) Always restore safety before opening a discussion. üé® Impressions The book teaches pratical techniques to deal better with high stake conversations and includes many examples. It is easy to digest and often feels obvious, but taking it into practice needs repetition and reflection."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://adrianstobbe.com/books/crucial-conversations/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://adrianstobbe.com/books/crucial-conversations/cover.jpg"><meta property="article:section" content="books"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2022-02-24T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2022-02-24T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Adrian's Site"><meta name=application-name content="Adrian's Site"><meta name=apple-mobile-web-app-title content="Adrian's Site"><link rel="shortcut icon" type=image/x-icon href=/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=192x192 href=/android-chrome-192x192.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=512x512 href=/android-chrome-512x512.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=manifest href=/site.webmanifest><link rel=canonical href=https://adrianstobbe.com/books/crucial-conversations/><link rel=stylesheet href=/lib/normalize/normalize.min.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.min.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/lib/animate/animate.min.css><script type=application/ld+json>{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Crucial Conversations - Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High","inLanguage":"en","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/adrianstobbe.com\/books\/crucial-conversations\/"},"genre":"books","wordCount":1052,"url":"https:\/\/adrianstobbe.com\/books\/crucial-conversations\/","datePublished":"2022-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","dateModified":"2022-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","description":""}</script><script type=application/ld+json>{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Home","item":"https:\/\/adrianstobbe.com\/"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Book-notes","item":"https://adrianstobbe.com/categories/book-notes/"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"Crucial Conversations - Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High"}]}</script></head><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-3F6G2KTRL9"></script>

Ofen, I would rather downplay my thoughts and opinions to avoid conflict or irritation. This of course does not lead to good outcomes. The book revealed to me that it&rsquo;s very possible to openly and honestly address touchy topics.</p><p>Many times discussions fail because, we are caught by our emotions. The concept of path to action makes clear how our strong feelings often stem from stories we make up from observations. We don&rsquo;t judge by facts but by stories. It takes attentive observation and thinking to step out of this vicious loop.</p><h2 id=-what-do-i-want-to-apply-to-my-life>üë∑üèº What do I want to apply to my life?</h2><p>Observe my signals of how I react to piling up emotions in crucial conversations.
Only then can I step back and remind myself what I&rsquo;m really trying to achieve. Only then can I question my story and think of other reasonable interpretations of the facts.</p><h2 id=-summary--notes>üìí Summary + Notes</h2><p>Forms of silence: masking, avoiding, withdrawing.<br>People get silent when safety is lost. Safety is when you can say anything.<br>Masking: underestimating, sugar coating: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite an unusual idea you came up with&rdquo;
Avoiding: change topics: &ldquo;What do you think of the dress?&mldr; I like that blue, it&rsquo;s my favorite color.&rdquo;
Withdrawing: exit conversation: &ldquo;Excuse me, I need to go and do x&rdquo;</p><p>Forms of violence: controlling, labeling, attacking.<br>Controlling: cut others off, overstate, change topic. Hyperboles are used due to lacking facts<br>Labeling: &ldquo;your ideas are Neanderthal.. Don&rsquo;t Listen, they are..&rdquo;
Attacking: belittle, say bad things about others</p><p>When we are verbally attacked, adrenaline kicks in and diverts blood flow from brain to body parts for flying. So, take a second and don&rsquo;t respond immediately to strong emotions.</p><p>We tend to stress small differences instead of looking for similarities. Try to agree and add. If you don&rsquo;t agree at all, compare the views, but don&rsquo;t disagree</p><h3 id=decision-making>Decision making</h3><p>See discussion as a way to collect views and ideas not as an approval to make decisions on others behalf.
Clear up how to make a decision. While everyone should add to the pool of meaning, not necessarily everyone is involved in the decision.

Instead of just fixing the Alarm clock, say sure if that helps that you are not late anymore.</p><p>On touchy topics. Mention difficulty to bring it up and show good intention.</p><p>Crucial conversations are not all or nothing. You cannot force the other to have dialogue, but by consistently signalling readiness for dialogue, you can eventually restore safety.</p><p>Touching can help restore safety among friends and family.</p><h3 id=0-reflect--prepare>0.

What I really wanted is to show you is&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Find similarities and agree: &ldquo;I totally agree that you were also taking efforts to visit mom and that these trips were not cheap. It&rsquo;s just that the costs I covered were even bigger&rdquo;</p><h3 id=5-getting-the-goal>5. Getting the goal</h3><p>Find common goals. People often pursue strategies: &ldquo;I want to stay here&rdquo;. But the higher goal is &ldquo;I want to be calm and not lose friends&rdquo;.</p><p>Make it easy for the other party to admit their fault: &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m sure you are in a hurry and the queue is enormous. I also don&rsquo;t have much time and needed to come here 2 hours early&mldr; Do you agree that we should all be dealt fairly? Since most of us have rough schedules?&rdquo;</p><p>Don&rsquo;t coerce through power, show them the consequences of their behavior. There is often a connection between something we want to change, and some consequence they care about but are not aware of.</p></div><div class=post style=padding-top:0><div class=post-share></div></div></div><div id=toc-final></div></article></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer" title="Hugo 0.111.3">Hugo</a> | Theme - <a href="https://ublogger.netlify.app/?utm_source=https://adrianstobbe.com/&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=config&utm_term=2.0.1" target=_blank title="uBlogger 2.0.1">uBlogger</a></div><div class=footer-line><i class="svg-icon icon-copyright"></i><span>2023</span></div></div></footer></div><div id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="svg-icon icon-arrow-up"></i>
