Before heading the focus to what&rsquo;s to come, I&rsquo;d like to look back on what 2022 held in store and share it with you. I set plenty of <a href="https://astobbe.me/posts/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">goals for 2022</a> and already knew that it would be a lot. My ambitious me wanted to keep the bar high, and so it comes to no surprise that not all of them were reached. But even though the metric wasn&rsquo;t reached, I want to focus on the gain rather than the gap. Lastly, I will share my core learnings and intentions for next year. Happy reading!</p>
<p>






</p>
<h2 id="review-of-my-goals">Review of my goals</h2>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p><strong>Write 15 blog posts</strong>
I failed to reach my goal of 15 blog posts, but published 9 and also wrote 7 letters. I enjoyed reading <a href="https://jenvermet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Jen Vermet&rsquo;s letters</a> a lot and inspired by them, I wanted to start expressing my emotional self. I wanted to lower my mental barrier of what is worth sharing to publish more. I spent a lot more time paying attention to how I feel and to the more human-side of what is going on around me.</p>
<p>My key discoveries on my personal journey were:</p>
<ul>
<li>being more vulnerable and controversial to express my thoughts and opinions. They don&rsquo;t need to be finished or completely thought through. I filter too much and am hence often silent</li>
<li>the distortions of my childhood: How I react to conflict, how I see friends, my emotional awareness, my zeal / obsession to work and be a high achiever. It felt good to acknowledge this and to try to resist my default.</li>
<li>emotional awareness and expression. I tend to filter out the emotional component and focus on the rational.</li>
<li>conflict resolution and difficult conversations. Stepping back in heated conflicts to really understand the other&rsquo;s needs and express care. This was a big step forward from my problem avoidant nature. But also setting boundaries to not disconnect from myself when I feel drained and not bending to try to please the other.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I review my journal learnings weekly and try to share them</strong>
While I journaled regularly during the first months of the year, my journaling felt through the cracks in the second half. I very often postponed until I was too tired or could not get into the mindset to reflect about my day. I got to share a bit about my world through my letters, but I am strongly determined to build a consistent journaling routine next year.</p>
<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
<p><strong>Do 7 learning projects</strong>
I also shared a few technical tutorials and open sourced as much of my thesis as possible. I want to keep this up and share, especially more of my learning projects. I wish to become more active in my learning by not just reading books and diving too deep into the nitty-gritty details that I too soon forget when not immediately needed. I intend to consume less, but actively test my understanding through posts and exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Have a plan what to do after graduation</strong>
I started thinking about my future after uni in autumn and realized that it&rsquo;s still too early to apply for anything. Now, I plan to start working in June 23 now and have a few ideas and options for then, but nothing is set in stone yet. I still have time.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><strong>Read 25 books</strong> &amp; <strong>Share 12 book notes</strong>
I read very few books this year and only posted 4 book notes, being far away from my goal. The reason being that I did not get hooked to the books I selected as much and lacking exciting titles to jump to. I&rsquo;ll set a lower goal for next year and discard books earlier when I don&rsquo;t like them. I&rsquo;m open to book recommendations!</p>
<h3 id="friends--love">Friends &amp; Love</h3>
<p><strong>Visit 2 friends</strong>
I shrank my friend circle, but got closer to those that really matter to me. In the first half, I was very open to meet new people and became much more confident to talk to strangers. I really enjoy these serendipitous and short fun interactions, but stopped doing it altogether, when I decided to channel more energy to those close to me. Why? I want more chitchat again in 2023! In June, my friend Celine came to visit in Berlin, and seeing each other in person after more than 1 year was a real game changer for our friendship. Being in-person just gives so much more time and space to get to know each other better (calls are often too infrequent + short to reach more than a catch-up), and obviously feels more alive and vibrant than an online call. I&rsquo;m happy I got to visit Celine in Switzerland at the end of the year for a weekend, and want to invest more energy into spending in-person time with my friends! I also had the same experience with my hitherto mostly online friend Simon from Bavaria, with whom I got to spend time together a few times this year. It&rsquo;s okay that these people are not living in the same city, but having in-person time is so much more personal and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Host 2 gatherings (dinner, party)</strong>
My new living space allowed to host more dinners with friends and to let visiting friends stay over. I&rsquo;m so glad about this, but I did not yet have a gathering to connect my friends with each other. This is in part due to my friends being spread remotely, but I could have been more proactive about some form of gathering.</p>
<p><strong>Engage with community and find 5 twitter friends</strong>
But besides in-person time, I also enjoyed meeting interesting characters online! I had a call with Jen, a few new connections through friends, found some cool people on Twitter and had people reach out to me about my blog. I want to strengthen connections with more likely-minded individuals through the internet in 2023! On the love side, I also got very lucky to get to know someone I can imagine my future with. She was a much bigger part of 2022 than this takes up in this review, but I won&rsquo;t disclose it all to you 😜 I didn&rsquo;t expect at all that things developed so fast between us, and I&rsquo;m learning a lot about myself with her.</p>
<h3 id="the-joy-of-music">The joy of Music</h3>
<p><strong>Explore 2 fun skills</strong>
I got to start a new hobby by learning the Ukulele. I&rsquo;m grateful to my host in Andalusia for taking away any excuses to not start by giving me the instrument. It&rsquo;s challenging, and I&rsquo;m still far from a good player, but I played it consistently throughout the entire year for a few minutes in the evening. It felt so easy to pick it up because it was so fun and rewarding to see my progress. Playing uke often refueled my energy tank after a long, exhausting day! Music is a great pleasure in my life. Besides dancing, and playing instruments, I also found a new genre that helps me relax and get into a reflective mood. You can listen to my spiritual, mostly Spanish <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/18DVZPPyRAiHP3ZNJDydzn?si=c664474b3ecd4c38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">gratitude playlist</a> on Spotify.</p>
<h3 id="all-the-rest">All the rest</h3>
<p><strong>Get my driver&rsquo;s license</strong>
After a long, mentally and financially costly odyssey, I reached my goal of <a href="https://astobbe.me/posts/drivers-license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">getting a driver&rsquo;s license</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do 1 sweet free month</strong> I also achieved to resist sweets for 30 days without big exceptions in July and August, after failing in April with repeated indulgences.</p>
<p><strong>Do 2 trips and spend some nights in a hotel</strong>
I&rsquo;m happy I got to do 2 trips (my brother trip to Italy got cancelled because I got sick right before :/). I spend more than two weeks in the Midwest in Minnesota with my girlfriend and got a few days in December in beautiful Bavaria. I&rsquo;m glad we spent one night at a fancy hotel, and it confirmed me that it is once in while so worth to treat yourself. The ambiance was nice, we had the Spa mostly to ourselves, a gym and breakfast for a few bucks more than a hostel. I want to be a bit less thrifty next year! Buying a big monitor was another hesitant purchase, but a good investment.</p>
<h2 id="take-ins-for-next-year">Take-ins for next year</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apply satisficing in my decision-making. I&rsquo;m often too hesitant to decide, even for trivia. I want to be less frugal and value my time and wellbeing over money. This is especially true for travel planning, spending money on non-essential convenience upgrades (big monitor, rice cooker).</li>
<li>Getting up early to journal and learn. I feel more in control over my day and that I achieve more when I catch the early worm. I want to track my waking hours and my learning hour.</li>
<li>Exercise is essential for my mental health. Taking even just 30 min to exercise feels like a reset to my body after feeling drained.</li>
<li>Plan and commit less, to do it well and be present. I don&rsquo;t want to constantly feel overwhelmed with what remains to be done. I want to commit to less non-essentials goals. Those whose outcome I would like, but whose journey I don&rsquo;t enjoy. I intend to be more flexible to do what feels meaningful and exciting in the now, rather than sticking to some non-essential goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you enjoyed reading and maybe got some aha-moment for your year!👋</p>

<p>This year I finally got the driver&rsquo;s license in Germany! However, it was not an easy way and I would like to share my experiences and tips to save you nerves, time and money!</p>
<h2 id="the-spanish-odyssey-to-the-driving-education">The Spanish odyssey to the driving education</h2>
<p>When I turned 17, I made a conscious decision, against the advice of all bystanders, not to get my driver&rsquo;s license during school like (almost) everyone else.
I didn&rsquo;t plan to buy a car and didn&rsquo;t need one in the city. In addition, I told myself that I could also do the license abroad at some point - where I wanted to go anyway. I had Spain or the USA in mind, where the driving license is also a lot cheaper.
However, I didn&rsquo;t take into account that inflation makes everything more expensive over a few years. In short, I would have paid similar prices last year for a driver&rsquo;s license in Spain as I did in 2017 in the Berlin area. In fact, I spent the winter of 2022 during my Erasmus in Barcelona and planned to finally do it there. However, I underestimated immensely that the examiners were completely booked after Corona lockdown and the city is also not an easy driving area - many driving hours&hellip;
I quickly realized that my few months abroad were too short and then considered going to a less precarious city in Seville for one or two months to complete the practical training there. The price there was also a lot cheaper. However, it finally failed because of the bureaucracy that says that you have to prove at least 6 months of residence.
The idea was practically ruined because it seemed too risky to bet everything on a few weeks in the summer that everything would go smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="the-training-in-berlin">The training in Berlin</h2>
<p>In the spring of 2022, I moved back to Berlin and finally decided to get my driver&rsquo;s license here - so that I finally have it!
Not surprisingly, the driving schools here were also overcrowded and the wait for exam dates stretched over several months. Some schools even had an admission freeze and many said that you should plan for more than 6 months.
However, due to my studies in Munich, it was not clear if I would stay in Berlin that long.
I looked for express courses and found hardly any offer. A driving school in Neukölln promised training in about a month with a hefty express surcharge.
Finally, I found the Dilek driving school in Wedding, which advertised fast test dates right away. The lady told me that I should expect costs around 2000 plus minus 500 euros. In addition, I could complete the theory there within 3 and a half weeks and 90 euros for 80 minutes of driving also seemed normal in Berlin.
And so began my journey to driving education, which quickly taught me some lessons I want to save you from.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-driving-school">Choosing a driving school</h2>
<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t choose a driving school under time pressure, because it takes so long with the others</li>
<li>transparent price structure: are all costs of the training listed in writing? I was surprised with costs for the switching proof, the theoretical examination and high examination costs, although I had asked in the discussion (only verbally) for all costs -&gt; written agreement over the conditions</li>
<li>Compare costs of driving schools with very many driving lessons (I would calculate with 50 times a 40 minutes. Most schools give double lessons). Do not trust the foreign cost estimate</li>
<li>no cash payment: for me a sign of lack of professionalism and also it makes the cost overview more difficult</li>
<li>how professional does the school seem? I had to change my driving instructor several times because they quit</li>
<li>always get a proof of driving lessons / receipt: expect that you want / need to change driving schools</li>
<li>it is much more expensive in the big city: do you have the possibility to do it somewhere else?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-choice-of-driving-instructor">The choice of driving instructor</h2>
<p>I involuntarily changed my driving instructor 4 times, 2 of which were due to driving instructors quitting. In general, I would make sure to pick an instructor who is personable, but at the same time not too quiet. Many instructors play on their cell phones, but there are also instructors who are attentive, challenge you, and point out mistakes. That&rsquo;s how it should be!</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h2>
<p>In the Berlin area a few years ago, instead of paying over 4000, I would have paid well under 2000 euros and saved myself more stress besides university and work. On the other hand, I would have used my driver&rsquo;s license only really very rarely in the last 4 years and would certainly have lost driving safety after such a long time. Nevertheless, in retrospect I would advise early training, because at some point you need the driver&rsquo;s license certainly times.</p>

Back then the predominant schools were Stoicisim, Epicureaunism and Cynicism. Around the same time, we are talking about 500 BC, Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism developed in Asia. With the rise of the world religions their popularity declined, but they have remained till today and so has the foundational value of having life principles.
Yet none of these ancient philosophy, have convinced me to become a full-hearted adopter.</p>
<p>Inspired by the readings of <a href="books/stoic-joy/" rel="">Stoic joy</a> and <a href="/books/how-to-live/" rel="">How to live</a>, I decided to go on my quest to define my life philosophy. Motivated by <a href="/books/principles/" rel="">Principles</a>, I am making them public for everyone to see.</p>
<p>The first question is: what makes up a life philosophy?
For me, it&rsquo;s the core of beliefs that guide what I do, how I make decisions and how I spend my energy and time.
It&rsquo;s not a definition of lofty goals or beliefs that every good-natured human holds - you may assume this about me ;) My life philosohpy is about those principles that define the core of my identity and deserve explanation by not being obvious.
It&rsquo;s the set of principels I hold now, but that are amendable to future changes.</p>
<p>I seperate these principles into doing and being. Doing relates to my actions and how I spend my energy. Being relates to my personality, thinking, beliefs and choices.</p>
<h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<h3 id="say-no">Say no</h3>
<p>Say no to work, people and places you don&rsquo;t like. Be reluctant to commit. Say you come back later to make a decision. Most bad decisions are made impulsively under pressure.</p>
<p>The more you take on, the less you will achieve.</p>
<p>Think twice before comitting to a plan. Even if it feels like &ldquo;hell yeah&rdquo; it&rsquo;s often worth to give it another thought when you feel less emotional about it. Everything seems more important in the moment. Write it down for later. Time tells how things really are.</p>
<p>It seems appealing to do x, to learn y, but what&rsquo;s the cost for your other priorities? Would you enjoy the process, or do you just want the outcome?</p>
<p>There are too many options. Commit.</p>
<h3 id="time-is-precious">Time is precious</h3>
<p>Time is limited an you don&rsquo;t want to regret not having had enough time for what really matters.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t watch movies, TV series or shows and don&rsquo;t play games. It&rsquo;s not a good use of time. If I do it&rsquo;s to socialize with friends as an exception.</p>
<p>Money can save time: by saving commute time, paying for the extra service, delegating tasks that are not a good time investment.</p>
<p>Respect other people&rsquo;s time and make an effort to be a good communicator.</p>
<p>Traditional 9 to 5 jobs go against the appreciation of time. It does not align with our own schedule and energy to be productive and measures work by time, when it should really be measured by value.
Are we really productive long-term working 8 or more hours?
Rather prefer to get a bit done every day.</p>
<h3 id="constant-learning">Constant learning</h3>
<p>A day without learning is a lost opportunity.</p>
<p>Be curious and unfearful of looking &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mistakes are an opportunity to learn. Record them and review them.</p>
<p>Ask for critique.</p>
<p>Learning is broad: technical skills, soft skills, understanding thinking and feelings of others, self-reflection..</p>
<p>Learning is the path to growth, it empowers, and is the seed for positive change.</p>
<p>Share your knowledge - through writing on the internet, open source projects. It might be useful to someone else. And what is knowledge worth if not shared / applied?</p>
<h3 id="get-wealthy">Get wealthy</h3>
<p>Provide value to society. Creating value without asking for anything in return is unsustainable.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sell yourself under value. Income is the path to financial freedom. <a href="#Time%20is%20precious" rel=""></a> and wealth is conditional to decide how to spend most of your time.</p>
<p>Wealth is money not spent. Stay a <a href="#Humble%20minimalist" rel=""></a>.</p>
<p>Reject the comfort of a steady paycheck. <a href="#Take%20reasonable%20risks" rel=""></a> and jump on opportunities.</p>
<p>Do what comes easily to you.</p>
<p>Settle for average returns from passive index funds.</p>
<p>Your home is an expense, not an investment.</p>
<h3 id="take-action">Take action</h3>
<p>Happiness is solving good problems.</p>
<p>Living up to ones core values manifests through action, not talking.</p>
<p>People try to explain the world, but the point is to change the world.
Ideas without execution are worthless.</p>
<p>A great speech can do the work of a thousand soldiers. Change minds. Speak up.</p>
<p>Suspend judgement from the first draft. Something bad can be improved upon. You can&rsquo;t improve nothing.</p>
<p>Wait to release a finished work. Move on to the next thing first, to feel less affected by public opinion. Their comments are about your past work.</p>
<h2 id="being">Being</h2>
<h3 id="plan-and-be-intentional">Plan and be intentional</h3>
<p>Planning is time not spent doing, so don&rsquo;t overdo it, but doing without planning is time poorly spent.
Plan your day ahead to not be distracted by the unimportant and impulses during the day.</p>
<p>As an introvert, reserve time for yourself. You can&rsquo;t be your best version for extended periods without time to step back and reconnect with yourself.</p>
<p>Schedule your day to &ldquo;act according to the goals of your highest self, not your passing mood.&rdquo; - How to live, Derek Sivers
Schedule quality time with friends, reserve focused time to learn, do preventative health checkups.</p>
<p>Rely on routines to lower the need for willpower. Willpower is limited.</p>
<p>Practice self-control to avoid impulses that distract me from my bigger priorities. Resist sweets, checking the phone, urge to escape discomfort once in a while. Prove to yourself you can.</p>
<p>Review your intentions and priorities in the afternoon when self-control is low.</p>
<p>Meet people out of curiosity and care not because it&rsquo;s been a while. Set an intention.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-thinking">Long term thinking</h3>
<p>Avoid indulging in activities that trade short term benefits against the long term. Your energy and time should be investments: be it learning, work, finance, but importantly also relationships and friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I only want to be around people that I know I’m going to be around with for the rest of my life. I only want to work on things that I know have long-term payout. - \cite{Naval Ravikant}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say no to what seems appealing in the moment. There is no free lunch. Junk food and sweets gives instant gratification while paying for how you feel later and your long-term health.</p>
<p>Food that tastes good is bad for you, and vice-versa. Eat to feel good rather than eating yummy to feel bad.</p>
<h3 id="filter-and-focus">Filter and focus</h3>
<p>Focus on the relevant. Most gossip and daily news are not worth knowing.</p>
<p>Do what you do whole-heartedly. Choose full attention to detail over absent-mindedness.</p>
<p>Find your skill to master. &ldquo;Mastery is a long-term pursuit, an investment that avoids the distraction of temporary impulses. You spend time intentionally. People don&rsquo;t fail by choosing the wrong path - they fail by not choosing. Passion comes after you start getting good.&rdquo; - How to live, Derek Sivers</p>
<p>Focus your energy on a few friends rather than spreading it over a dozen.
Cut ties with people that don&rsquo;t align with your values.</p>
<h3 id="dont-cave-in---no-regrets">Don&rsquo;t cave in - no regrets</h3>
<p>Resist the pressure to conform and do things because of societies expectations.</p>
<p>Embrace to be an outsider who deviates from the norm.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t follow external expectations, you will only lament later how all of it did not really matter. Don&rsquo;t take life too seriously. People usually care less and we are the strictest with ourselves.</p>
<p>Ask what you want. Learn to be rejected. Do what you want now and don&rsquo;t postpone it for later. Later extends until it&rsquo;s too late. Take reasonable risks.</p>
<p>Expect the worst. It&rsquo;s outside your control how much time you have with loved ones, but you can enjoy the present and express gratitude today.</p>
<p>Visualizing the worst, avoids later regrets, because it makes you appreciate the now.</p>
<h3 id="before-adding-try-subtracting">Before adding, try subtracting</h3>
<p>New things promise some upside, but what about the downsides? Addiction, scattered focus, wasted time..</p>
<p>Try not to fix things by swallowing that pill, but instead remove what is causing the pain.</p>
<p>Less is more.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to be more right. Just be less wrong.
Before adding niceties, avoid doing harm first. One terrible thing can destroy an entire relationship.
Most of being a good person is not doing bad.</p>
<h3 id="humble--minimalist">Humble &amp; minimalist</h3>
<p>Have as few possessions as possible. Anything additional is baggage. Keep it easy to move places and don&rsquo;t be fixated to belongings.</p>
<p>Happiness is a state without desires.</p>
<p>Minimize your dependencies. Reject consumerism and materialism. It doesn&rsquo;t bring happiness, but just leads to a never ending spiral of desire for more.</p>
<p>By stoic ideals, appreciate what you have. Don&rsquo;t admire rich people, but pity them for their high standards to feel happy.
Being minimalistic means there is less to lose.</p>
<p>Be frugal to become financially independent. Spending money doesn&rsquo;t make happy, but freedom of choice does. Aspire to work because it&rsquo;s meaningful, not to pay the bills.</p>
<h3 id="live-with-nature">Live with nature</h3>
<p>Appreciate our natural habit. Preserve its beauty by foremost minimizing harm. Not to the extreme of severly compromising life quality, but by avoiding the unnecessary and compensating for the accepted burden. Avoid, reduce, compensate - in that order.</p>
<p>Move to a quiet place with lots of nature. Enjoy the surroundings.
Nature is healing. It&rsquo;s a reminder of what is too much in cities.</p>
<p>Care about the other animals on the planet. Eat mostly vegetables.</p>
<h3 id="live-for-others">Live for others</h3>
<p>Be a good listener, ask deep questions. Nobody asks because most are not interested. Curiosity comes from the attitude that everybody has something to learn from. Don&rsquo;t fake interest.</p>
<p>Most of us are caught in our head, but make the effort to feel and think how they do. There is plenty of time to think for yourself in solitude. Be present.</p>
<p>When talking, don&rsquo;t dwell on telling how great you are. Focus on being helpful to others. Share what you know and might be relevant to them. Make them feel great. Most people don&rsquo;t care about how happy I am or how passionate or proud I am of x. Admiration and appreciation comes from decency and deeds.
Talking is the chance to learn and to give to others.</p>
<p>Do something to help people without self-interest.</p>
<p>People with strong social ties are happier.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t hear enough compliments. Tell people when you think something nice about them.</p>
<h3 id="love-and-feel">Love and feel</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The first step to love is to give it your full attention and deliberately appreciate it&rdquo; - How to live, Derek Sivers</p>
<p>Be wary of marriage. Dont make a life-long commitment based on an emotional state.</p>
<p>Love your partner more than your children. This is how they learn what love is.</p>
<p>Learn about people to empathize with them. Humans love to be understood. Don&rsquo;t just try to fix problems. Listen and understand their feelings.</p>
<p>You can only feel loved if you choose to  <a href="#Be%20honest" rel=""></a> and are your true self.</p>
<p>Notice who brings out the best in you and makes you feel more connected  with yourself.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to impress. Impress yourself.</p>
<p>Admit what you are really feeling, even when it&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<h3 id="friends">Friends</h3>
<p>Make time for your relationships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live among fellow freaks, where obsession is normal and ambition is rewarded&rdquo; - How to live, Derek Sivers</p>
<p>Keep friends at a healthy distance. Get close to truly know and care about each other but not too close to become dependent.
Sincere appreciation and engagement with their interests is the foundation for friendship.</p>
<p><a href="#Long%20term%20thinking" rel=""></a> also applies to friends. Meet regularly to maintain and continously grow the connection.</p>

<h3 id="be-honest">Be honest</h3>
<p>I avoid environments where I need to watch what I say. I am honest in my words and actions. There is no higher quality than trustworthiness and integrity. I want to rely on people and in return I commit to keep my word.</p>
<p>I admit own mistakes and apologize.</p>
<p>Always say the truth, taking the painful consequences. What could excuse an exception?</p>
<h3 id="pursue-pain">Pursue pain</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s worthy comes with pain: love comes with attachment, success comes with frustration and failures, deep connection comes from being vulnerable, exploration comes with fear. Make pain a choice rather than seeing it as necessary evil.</p>
<p>Asking what you want comes with the potential pain of being rejected.</p>
<p>Being honest is uncomfortable and painful for our self-image, to others. It might mean accepting a punishment. But defering the truth is much more painful.</p>

Invest in your early personal growth.</p>
<p>Personalities are fluid.

<p>Many unfortunate events are outside your control. You can only control your reaction to them.</p>
<p>If you fail to pursue what you want, it&rsquo;s because of you. Don&rsquo;t compare yourself with other more fortunate individuals. There are even more people who are less fortunate.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask &ldquo;why did this happen to me&rdquo;. Everyone has their own burden. Do your best.</p>
<p>Taking responsibility instead of pin pointing to others feels empowering. You are in control.</p>

<p>Every day pick a moment that is storyworthy. See life as a story. Stories are the remains of an experience. Make great adventures, but tell greater stories.</p>
<p>Journal every day.</p>
<p>A long and healthy life you can&rsquo;t remember is not worth much.</p>
<p>Pursue novelty. Live in different places. Change your work environment.</p>

<p>2022 is maybe the most exciting year so far.
I spent January still on my Erasmus semester in Barcelona. I had exams this month, but I still made time to explore new things. I had my first deprivation tank experience, tried light therapy glasses and went to a magic show by <a href="https://www.luispardo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Luis Pardo</a>.
<figure>
</figure>
</p>
<p>I challenged myself to talk to a stranger every day: and found out that most people actually enjoy small talk. It opens for serendipity: I got to meet a guy on the subway who is from the same small town in Cadiz where I would go in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Living in places, not as a tourist, but by staying there for some time, is how I like to explore.
After Beijing, Munich and Barcelona, I decided to go for my first digital nomad experience.
I went to Cadiz in the sunny south of Spain for about 4 weeks. I loved the proximity to the sea in Barcelona, but I wanted to explore a more tranquile and nature-based place.
A free room in an apartment with a charming lady in her fifties (it&rsquo;s rude to ask the age right) brought me to El Puerto de Santa Maria. A small town at the coast line facing the peninsula of the city Cadiz. I am happy I did it and I learned a few things about myself and on how I want to live:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This year, I lived my first month as a digital nomad in Spain, Cadiz.<br>I lived in a small town called El puerto in a shared flat with an older lady. These are my takeaways:</p>&mdash; Adrian Stobbe (@astobbe_) <a href="https://twitter.com/astobbe_/status/1500104636090531854?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I did a windsurf course, enjoyed bathing in the sea in the late afternoon, and taking walks.
I hope I documented more of my experience, but I particularly remember the horse riding day with Johanna and the day at the beautiful, mostly untouched beach in Los Caños de Meca. My nice host Lola proposed the trip and brought me and my friends Stefan and Juno from the windsurf course there by car (you need a car in Andalusia!).
I remember the adventurous mountain trip to a beautiful lagoon in Algeciras with Hector and the monkey day at the rock of Gibraltar.</p>
<p><figure>

</p>
<p>At the end of the month, I returned to Munich for an exam and got to see my friends again. I truly enjoyed my days with them and realized how my friendships had improved. I went skiing for the first time in my life with my old school friend Maxi.</p>
<figure>
</figure>

<p>And March was yet another great month. I got back to my family in Berlin and enjoyed Urban sports to the fullest. I went to lots of dancing classes, swimming, to the gym + sauna and I went on a bouldering date with a special person.
On this date, I met a midwestern girl that for the first time ever gave me the feeling of a soulmate. We think alike in so many ways: the curiosity to explore new places and perspectives, being intentional, the desire for deep connection&hellip; I could go on, but I spare you the rest.
I got hella lucky to meet this girl on a dating app: Bumble (yeah did not expect this neither).
We bonded in no time and everything just seemed right.
In June I went to see her family in the U.S. and had a wonderful time. I was surprised to find bigger cultural differences than I expected and changed my perspective on how I want to treat my family and see my friends. I learned a lot about <a href="https://astobbe.me/letters/love-and-feel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my emotions</a> and the value of <a href="https://astobbe.me/letters/thinking-out-loud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">thinking out loud</a>.
My highlights were the days at the family&rsquo;s cabin by a lake, and the camping night at Lake Superior.
Shaped by the car dependence in the U.S. and earlier in Cadiz, I was more determined than ever to get my driver&rsquo;s license and finally started when I got back.
In June, I also moved into my own flat in the heart of Berlin. Growing up in the suburbs of Berlin, its quite another experience to live in the most buzzing place and getting everywhere within much fewer time. Shortened commute time is worth a lot, because commute often was an impediment to go out in the first place. Now I miss the greenery at times, but you can&rsquo;t have it all. As I recently learned, Berlin is one of the greenest cities in Europe, so I just need to take advantage of the many parks.</p>
<h2 id="status-update-of-my-life-areas-and-goals">Status update of my life areas and goals</h2>
<h3 id="life">Life</h3>
<p>I appreciate to be close to my family, because I know it won&rsquo;t be permanent. I feel fortunate to live by mself in a place that is so close to work and central. A wonderful human being entered my life this year and I am learning so much about my emotions and childhood distortions (nothing dramatic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFKzE52XRmw&amp;ab_channel=TheSchoolofLife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">everyone has them</a> 😉 ).</p>
<p>After my thesis submission, I want to consciously take more time to do things I tend to put off because x needs to be done first. I want to live my life today and not postpone it to the future.
I want to try new things, do trips, invest in deep friendships, visit the people I care about.</p>
<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
<p>I set the goal to do 7 learning projects this year.
So far, I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>finish my <a href="https://github.com/elchead/people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">first offline PWA (progressive web app)</a>: I am still not 100% happy with the app and it has some issues on Safari iOS lately. I&rsquo;m thinking about switching to Obsidian, but the learning experience with Typescript and PWA features was the main motivation.</li>
<li>learn rust: read <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Rust in Action</a>; completed all <a href="https://github.com/elchead/rustlings-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rustlings exercises</a></li>
<li>went to <a href="https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">We are devs</a> conference. I realized that I miss out on a lot of events in my tech sphere, because I don&rsquo;t keep myself up-to-date. I found out too late that KubeCon was in Valencia this year. I would have loved to go. I want to stay more informed through Twitter (how I found we are devs), maybe LinkedIn and tech communities (meetup? online?). If you have any recommendations, please tell me :)</li>
<li>continue Uncle Bobs <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/clean-code-fundamentals/9780134661742/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Clean Code Fundamentals</a> video course: it&rsquo;s highly entertaining and I have lots to learn. I stopped watching the course due to thesis pressure and other priorities, but I want to continue, refine my notes and eventually share them on the blog</li>
</ul>
<p>I am interested to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>practice my vim / IDE shorcut skills. I want to explore another IDE than VS Code that has more powerful refactoring and automation capabilities (thinking of Jetbrains)</li>
<li>explore optimizations in the terminal. Starting last year, I leveled up my terminal with oh-my-zsh and some nice plugins, but I am still not using it to the fullest. I know about fzf but I don&rsquo;t use it. Here are <a href="https://github.com/elchead/dotfiles/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my dotfiles</a>. If you have any plugin recommendation, please reach out :) I am also curious on the <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">warp project</a> and might try it out</li>
<li>learn about web3: the space and innovations going on.. On the tech side, I want to learn about substrate and polkadot. I visited a <a href="https://substrate.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">substrate</a> workshop earlier and want to get involved in a project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="habits">Habits</h3>
<p>I see habits as the empowerment for positive change. Taking a learning hour off in the morning is the first step to reach my goal on the learning projects. Setting a rule to get to bed by 22.30 pm is my condition for a good start of the day and being productive.
Yet, I am not particularily consistent.
The only habit I am fairly consistent with is practicing Ukulele: it takes only few minutes and is fun.
As part of my <a href="https://astobbe.me/posts/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">yearly goals</a>, I decided to do a sweet free month and failed. My longest streak was 7 days, because of single days where I failed (also due to social pressure ^^). I only recorded 32 sweet free days this year until know.</p>
<p>My most important habit is journaling and while I almost always do it in the morning, the more important day reflection is in the evening, where I often fail. Mostly, I lack energy and am not in thinking mood. I need to take my winddown routine (yoga streching, meditation, chill music) more seriously. I also recently discovered<a href="https://twitter.com/astobbe_/status/1552346810974408706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"> iPhone + keyboard </a> as a good mobile combination that works on public transport and avoids big bright light before going to bed. I just bought a stand for my iPhone - let&rsquo;s see how that goes.
I generally find myself to have low self-discipline in the evening (quite understandably as a morning person..) and often also don&rsquo;t go to bed on time.</p>
<p>As a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be persistent with not allowing distractions in the morning. No phone in the morning (until 10am at least)</li>
<li>I need to acknowledge my low self-discipline at night and rely more on my sleep reminder to tell me to winddown. I want to incorporate yoga streching to see if it helps with sleep. I also experimented with theanine, but it seems to make me feel very sleepy in the morning and live stronger dreams. I want to sleep by 22.30 pm latest.</li>
<li>I want to meditate every day.</li>
<li>I want to try the no-sweet challenge again</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p>I already wrote 9 blog plosts this year, 8 letters and published 5 book notes. This is more than last year, and I also got two positive feedbacks from strangers so far. I recently started tracking my blog analytics and found out that I get some fair traffic from Google and most of it on my <a href="https://astobbe.me/posts/building-a-journaling-habit-with-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Obsidian article on Journaling</a>. So far, I&rsquo;ve been mostly writing for myself and I want to keep it that way. However, I want to practice my writing style and build a small audience.</p>
<p>Inspired by Jen Vermet, I am thinking of joining the <a href="https://writeofpassage.school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Write of Passage</a> (if I get a scholarship). I also want to get some tips and feedback from writing friends. Maybe, I would like to be more active in an online-community. I recently joined <a href="https://nesslabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Nesslabs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
<p>Say no. I still find myself comitting and saying yes to things I don&rsquo;t want. Don&rsquo;t make spontaneous, impulsive decision-making. Rather defer it and think about it in a quiet moment.</p>
<p>Being over doing. I feel I constantly have to do something. But sometimes it&rsquo;s just nice to be with myself and feel my emotions. I often catch myself escaping my emotions.</p>
<p>Procrastination is a natural protection. I constantly tend to put too much stuff on my todos. I don&rsquo;t need to feel bad that I can&rsquo;t do it all. Many of it, feels exciting or important in the moment, but if it is really important to me just shows when I gain more distance from the thought. Do less and fully engage in what I do.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make it too delicious. I want to eat to feel good afterwards not to feel good in the moment. I often tend to eat too much in a single meal and feel tired afterwards. Eating something less delicious (usually also more healthy..) helps to eat for my health instead of against it.</p>
<p>Coffee is a potent drug for me. I get into highly focused states and have almost ecstatic levels of happiness at times. I need to be careful with it because it also causes diarrea (caffeine increases colonic activity..) and it seems to have a very long half life for me, which can interfere with my sleep.</p>
<p>Start the day early and with intention. It makes me feel much better.</p>
<h2 id="thought-bits">Thought bits</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do an <a href="https://jamesclear.com/2016-integrity-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">integrity report</a> ever since I read <a href="https://astobbe.me/books/atomic-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Atomic habits</a> and plan to do it (at least by the end of this year 😉).
The core questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the core values that drive my life and work?</li>
<li>How am I living and working with integrity right now?</li>
<li>How can I set a higher standard in the future?</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, I want to thank Jen Vermet, who reminded me to do this (yeah, it&rsquo;s almost August already) through her <a href="https://learnitalletter.substack.com/p/-letter-119-my-semi-annual-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">review letter</a>. I highly recommend her newsletter. Her letters are very introspective, personal and a great inspiration for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for what&rsquo;s to come in the 5 remaining months and you can expect my annual review at the end of the year!
I want to finish off with a nice quote from an email signature that Michael Pollan read many years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope whatever you are doing , you stop once in awhile and not doing it at all
<cite>- The mind on plants, Michael Pollan</cite></p>

We all have such impulses:
like mindlessly scrolling social media in the morning, eating junk food, or too many coffee-breaks at work. They can be manifold, but they are so enticing in the moment, because they temptate us with immediate pleasure or stress release.
It&rsquo;s when our primitive, short-term thinking mind tries to get control. In the book &ldquo;Thinking Fast and Slow&rdquo;, Daniel Kahneman describes two modes of thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>“System 1” = The instant, unconscious, automatic, intuitive thinking.</li>
<li>“System 2” = The slower, conscious, rational, deliberate thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primitive impulses come from System 1 and when we don&rsquo;t deliberately observe ourselves, we follow them.
In short: System 1 is the default, System 2 needs attention.</p>
<h2 id="system-1-in-action">System 1 in action</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s System 1, when I come home late exhausted from the day and give in to an eating crave. System 2 knows it&rsquo;s bad, but when my energy is low, it becomes hard to think; hard to resist.
It&rsquo;s also System 1 that tempts me to eat 5 pieces of cake, although System 2 knows that I won&rsquo;t feel good afterwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s System 1, that when getting my phone to find something, urges me to check for new messages.
System 2 knows it&rsquo;s bad, because I become distracted, sometimes agitated, and forget what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also System 1, that entertains itself with daydreaming or grooving to music while doing boring, mundane activities such as packing things. System 1 works well, when it&rsquo;s habitual, when we don&rsquo;t need to think. But slight deviations, such as things not being in the exact same place or something additional that needs to be thought, let the system fail.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-impulses">Dealing with impulses</h2>
<h3 id="save-energy-with-routines">Save energy with routines</h3>
<p>Always being in System 2 mode is too expensive and we wouldn&rsquo;t get things done. Willpower is limited.
So it&rsquo;s crucial to focus System 2 on the important. Routines help to take the burden of System 2, so it pays off to routinize reoccurring problems.<br>
If I make it a rule to brush my teeth, when I get foot in the door late, it makes it a bit easier to resist the food craving.
When I turn off notifications or use my laptop instead of the phone, it becomes easier to avoid distraction.</p>
<h3 id="mastering-self-control">Mastering Self-control</h3>
<p>Fortunately, our lifes are not just montonous routines. Many situations are unexpected and our feelings vary.
The reason we keep doing harmful things is that our System 2 is not sharply observing or is lacking will power to tame System 1.
The first step is to step out of automatic mode and shift the focus to the present. Meditation is good practice for this. By shifting the focus on the breath and not doing anything else, it becomes easier to observe the mind.</p>
<p>After becoming aware of our impulses, the challenge is to substitute something immediately rewarding against some more far-distant and currently non-tangible benefit.
The problem is that our lazy-self seeks to maximize present reward.</p>
<p>But how do we work against our lazy pleasuring seeking self to pursue something that pays off long term?</p>
<p>Here comes the power of self-control. Learning to resist, to say no. The key to build positive habits is self-control. Saying no is much more important than saying yes.
Saying yes is easy, it&rsquo;s indulging, gives immediate rewards and avoids problems (in the very moment).
Saying no is uncomfortable. Be it external like turning down an invitation or ask for help, or internal like resisting an urge to eat junk food. Most often we / our System 2 knows we should say no, but we lack self-control.
We forego the long-term reward of sticking to our high priorities to avoid imminent pain and discomfort. Even if the pain will be much higher in the future.</p>
<p>But saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; can be pleasing. Every time we say it, it&rsquo;s a proof of strength, self-determination, and a clear and focused mind. Isn&rsquo;t this a nice compliment to yourself?
Exercise feels rewarding after overcoming the inertia to go and pushing the body to it&rsquo;s limits. Work is rewarding after solving a hard, frustrating problem.
We constantly pursue comfort in all aspects of life, but comfort is not fullfilling, it&rsquo;s not rewarding.
We should instead associate discomfort; that is saying no with rewards.</p>
<p>Self-control unlocks positive change by letting us focus on the important, but more importantly by steering us away from the harmful. And like everything else, we can practice it. So I invite you to find your impulses in your day. Find small things, such as not checking the phone, or not eating the first time you feel the urge. <a href="https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/optimize-your-brain-with-science-based-tools-huberman-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Dr. Huberman</a> coins these NO-GO&rsquo;s and tries to find 15 small NO-GO&rsquo;s every day. But it&rsquo;s better to start small than not at all. My big NO-GO are sweets this month.
What&rsquo;s yours?</p>

It did not work out of the box and many instructions on the internet did not work for me.
In the following, I want to share my setup.
To set up the network and VMs, I followed <a href="https://blog.nillsf.com/index.php/2021/10/29/setting-up-kubernetes-on-azure-using-kubeadm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this tutorial</a>. After installing the <a href="https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/getting-started/kubernetes/self-managed-onprem/onpremises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">default configuration of calico</a>, inter-node communication between pods did not work.</p>
<p>My working approach uses User-Defined-Routes (UDR) on Azure to route traffic from the different pod-subnets of each node.
Be sure to only have one IP address assigned to each network interface! I installed the Azure CNI plugin before, which assigns pod IPs from the secondary IPs of the vnet that are assigned to the network interface. This caused problems in the IP detection in Calico, but it can be easily fixed by deleting the secondary IPs.</p>
<p>When bootstrapping Kubernetes, you should also set the pod subnet (CIDR) to avoid address overlap with the virtual network.
The default for kubeadm is <code>192.168.0.0/16</code> which indeed overlapped with my Azure network.</p>
<p>This is my kubeadm config:</p>

<p>Before applying I recommend to set up VXLAN instead of ipip mode (see below).
By default, calico uses ipip tunneling for pod communication. A tunnel is a virtual network interface to connect subnets. This did not work in my Azure network.
Instead, I configured VXLAN.</p>

This might be useful if you want to use new features that are not yet merged in the upstream. For development, it&rsquo;s of course much easier to set up a local cluster (<code>./hack/local-up-cluster.sh</code>), but to test functionality across different nodes, you might need a distributed cluster.</p>
<p>One option is to install it <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">The hard way</a>, but I think it&rsquo;s more convenient to use <code>kubeadm</code>.
The challenge is that you need container images for the kube control-plane components.</p>
<p>I found it difficult to find good documentation on this process, so I hope to help you along with this.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>By default Kubeadm pulls the Kubernetes version matching the version of kubeadm from the official registry. But it also allows to specify a custom registry.
To install our custom Kubernetes, we will need to build and pull the required container images, tag them with the expected version of kubeadm, and the push them to our registry.</p>
<h2 id="build-images">Build images</h2>
<p>I built the images on a Ubuntu machine, since the build is resource intensive.
Kubernetes is big, so be sure to have enough space on the VM! The build happens inside a docker container, so make sure to have docker installed. VMs usually only have a small disk image, so I created a symbolic link to save the docker files on another attached drive (here mounted on <code>/mnt</code>):</p>

</div>
</div><p>Then, inside the kubernetes root path, specify your docker registry and run:
<code>KUBE_SERVER_PLATTFORMS=&quot;linux/amd64&quot; KUBE_DOCKER_REGISTRY=&quot;sadrian99&quot; KUBE_RELEASE_RUN_TESTS=n ./build/release-images.sh</code>
I recommend to set a flag for the image version such that the version coincides with what kubeadm expects (version of kubeadm).
In my case, this was <code>v1.19.16</code>.</p>
<h2 id="tag-images-and-push-to-registry">Tag images and push to registry</h2>
<p>The generated image names have a trailing <code>amd64</code> which needs to be removed for <code>kubeadm</code>:
<code>IMGN</code>: new name for kubadm
<code>IMG</code>: old image name
<code>VER</code>: old version tag
<code>VERN</code>: new version tag
<code>REPO</code>: your container registry url
In my case, <code>REPO=sadrian99</code> and <code>VERN=v.19.16</code>. Then we tag the image with the new name:</p>

<li>kube-proxy:v1.19.16</li>

<p>Additionally you need to pull these images and copy them to your registry:</p>
<ul>
<li>pause:3.2</li>
<li>etcd:3.4.7-0</li>
<li>coredns:1.6.7</li>

</div><h2 id="kubeadm-bootstrap">Kubeadm bootstrap</h2>
<p>You can test if the images are all available:
<code>kubeadm config images pull --image-repository sadrian99 </code></p>
<p>Then you can add <code>--image-repository sadrian99</code> to the <code>init</code> command to bootstrap your cluster.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Statelessness is the basic foundation for microservices run inside Kubernetes. Outside it&rsquo;s main application domain, the platform also appeals to the High Performance Computing (HPC) community for that infrastructure management can be delegated to cloud providers and it&rsquo;s on-demand scaling. The challenge is that HPC jobs are usually long running and stateful. Jobs such as simulations or optimization problems usually keep their state in memory and state checkpointing on disk is not always available.
This is undesirable because failures are expected to occur.
Matters becomes even worse for jobs with unpredictable resource requirements. Unexpected spikes in memory can lead to out-of-memory node situations, which results in pods being killed. The catastrophic consequence is the complete loss of job progress from many hours or even days of compute time.
To avoid this, a migration of stateful pods to another node would be desirable.</p>
<h2 id="status-quo">Status quo</h2>
<p>Currently, Kubernetes does not support pod migration.
However, a PoC of a pod migration n prior work by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349662156_Migrating_Pods_in_Kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Jakob Schrettenbrunner</a> showed the feasibility. A <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">proposal</a> to support very basic checkpointing (forensic checkpoiting without restore) functionality has recently been accepted by the Kubernetes community as well and is expected to be available in future releases.</p>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Building on the prior PoC of Jakob Schrettenbrunner, I want to show you step by step how to set up a Kubernetes cluster with pod migration functionality. Bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster from scratch is not a trivial task, but <code>kubeadm</code> will help us. Jakob also provided some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5p_FOHDGAp5YEQ23dCi9I8wPnMzd4aOazxI4uO_AMo/edit#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">documentation</a> on his setup and while very helpful it is far from complete and does not mention all potential gotchas. You might suspect already that this won&rsquo;t be a quick and easy process, but I hope to make it a lot easier for you through this extensive tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>To see what to expect, here is a quick demo of the steps to migrate a pod:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPY852th_T0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="1-cluster-setup">1. Cluster setup</h2>
<p>The cluster consists of 1 master node and 2 worker nodes. The VMs are provisioned in Microsoft Azure. For migrating the pod across a worker node, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/files-smb-protocol?tabs=azure-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Azure&rsquo;s SMB file share server</a>) is used. You might also use an NFS server (and it might even make things easier as mentioned later..), but this was not possible for company policy reasons in my case.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is bootstrapped using <code>kubeadm</code>. It&rsquo;s tested with version <code>v1.19.0-beta.0.1015+b521fb5114995f-dirty</code> ( binaries are available <a href="https://github.com/elchead/kubernetes/releases/tag/v8.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>, but I recommend building from source).</p>
<h3 id="network-setup">Network setup</h3>
<p>To set up the cluster network, I followed <a href="https://blog.nillsf.com/index.php/2021/10/29/setting-up-kubernetes-on-azure-using-kubeadm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this tutorial</a>. You can use the web shell on Azure for this:</p>

<p>As mentioned <a href="https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/issues/860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>, recent Ubuntu kernels broke compatibility with CRIU.
Hence we downgrade the kernel:

<p>Through <code>kubectl get po -owide</code>, you can get pod IP and increment a stateful counter.
Be sure to do this on the worker node:
<code>curl $POD_IP:8080</code>
Repeat the counter increment a few times, to validate the successful migration later.</p>

</div><p>The migration should be very fast.
Currently, the old pod gets broken during the migration. But the cloned pod should be running.
Requesting it&rsquo;s endpoint with <code>curl</code> should return a number bigger than 1. Voila - you have successfully cloned a stateful pod in Kubernetes!</p>
<h2 id="6-set-up-file-server">6. Set up file server</h2>
<h3 id="important-warning">Important warning</h3>
<p>I had consistency problems for bigger file uploads with SMB. The container restore command is issued 1 second after the disk checkpoint has been saved completely.
However, at this time not all files of the checkpoint directory were uploaded successfully.</p>
<p>I circumvented this problem by storing the checkpoint on local disk and only storing a zipped archive on the server.
The temporary local-disk location is <code>/var/lib/kubelet/check</code>. Since, the OS disk is usually only 30GB, you will need to create a symbolic link to a bigger disk. In my case, a temporary disk with 500GB was mounted in <code>/mnt</code>.
To solve this, do:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">ln -s /mnt /var/lib/kubelet/check
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>Interestingly, the compression immensly reduced the checkpoint size for the simple example app. For 50GB of allocated memory, the compressed zip was only around 20MB!
This modification was done inside containerd in the branch <code>checkpoint-zip</code>.</p>
