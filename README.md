# Blog
This is the code for [my website](https://www.adrianstobbe.com).
It's the 3rd generation. The main reason being a much simpler setup and being able to manage the blog content as git repo inside my Obsidian-vault.
The enhancement also makes the [blog-cli](https://github.com/elchead/blog-cli) obsolete.

You can find the old Hugo (v2) and Jekyll (v1) blog in the branch list.
