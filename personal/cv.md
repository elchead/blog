# 👨‍💻 Work experience

## Development of a Postprocessing tool for Combustion Experiments

***Working student**, TU Berlin - Institute of Fluid Dynamics, (Oct 2018 - Sept 2019)*

Built an automated **Python** script for postprocessing experimental data. The tool can read entire measurement campaigns, create individual plots, and evaluate the success rate (detonation detection) for different configurations. I was in main-charge of the development, but collaborated with the research group through **Git.** 

## Insights into manufacturing

***Technical intern,** Ingenieurbetrieb Bickert, (Apr 2019- Jun 2019)*

Assisted production and was introduced to company management and working procedures at a local milling engineering company.

## CFD development with FEM and SPH

***Intern, Bachelor thesis, working student,** dive solutions GmbH,  (since May 2020)*

I learned about the theory of **porous media** and a particle-based CFD method called SPH and developed a 1D solver for porous media in **Python** to solidify my understanding. Furthermore, I supported an industrial cooperation project. I conducted complex simulations by preparing the geometry using **CAD** software, building the setup in the company's **Python** interface, and evaluated the results in presentations for the client. I got involved in the **C++** solver development and integrated additional physical models.

As part of my thesis, I developed a **FEM** porous media solver from scratch with **C++.** After that, I coupled FEM-SPH for simulating free-fluid-flow and porous-flow interactions. After validating the solver, I demonstrated the industrial capability by simulating a rotating 3D washing drum.
