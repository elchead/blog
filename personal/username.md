title: Why elchead?
---

While searching for a username that would peculiarly reflect me, this turned out to be the most encompassing cipher.
It stems from my interest in the second-brain idea, which has transformed me and how I organize significantly. I immediately saw the connection to the interesting word composition of the Chinese word for computer - electrical brain. Substituting the latter with the more modest word head lead me to elechead. Finally, I couldn't resist incorporating my German roots by making a reference to the animal Elch, i.e., moose in English.

So that's the story. It's definitely too intricate to be understood by looking at the word, but enough to confuse German speakers on reading it. ðŸ˜„

Maybe this also gives you some inspiration to come up with a username that you can identify with. I'd be curious to know!
